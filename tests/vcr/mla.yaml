        the narrator of Invisible Man, the abjection of women and homosexuals operates
        at first as a discursive strategy for making the black male\u2019s position
        more subjectively endurable, but the narrator must eventually confront this
        discursive strategy as an illusion of hetero-phallic agency, since he continually
        fails to acquire the sorts of instrumentalities of power associated with directly
        political speech. In the end, he recognizes possession of the phallus as a
        myth on the order of Santa Claus and opts for a more obviously representational,
        but less obviously political, discourse: his narrative. If we are to take
        the novel itself as the evidence of the invisible man\u2019s agency, though,
        then this agency is entirely representational: it acts in and on the world
        only as a shifty fiction, a tricky Word.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>https://commons.mla.org/deposits/item/mla:7</identifier><datestamp>2015-05-04T17:52:52Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc

        paper explores the literary potential of the personal blog, arguing that the
        form may usefully understood in relationship to the early novel.  As it has
        been argued that the representations of individual characters in the early
        novel helped to bring the modern understanding of the individual into being,
        so this paper argues that the character produced through the database-oriented
        form of the blog is bringing into being a new form of networked subjectivity.
        \ In order to fully appreciate the pleasure entailed in reading blogs, however,
        one must add to this understanding of the functions of narrative and database
        an understanding of seriality, and particularly the feminized form of serial
        typified by the soap opera.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>https://commons.mla.org/deposits/item/mla:25</identifier><datestamp>2015-05-06T13:32:15Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc

        ability to counteract \"too smooth\" and \"inauthentic\" contemporary technologies

        Description: As German intellectual Walter Benjamin writes in his essay \u201CThe
        Storyteller\u201D, \u201CExperience which is passed on from mouth to mouth
        is the source from which all storytellers have drawn.\u201D In the process
        of sharing experiences, more stories are born with authorship that are common
        while at the same time recognizing the individual opening of the hearer and
        the teller. In this course, we will explore storytelling as a way to understand
        the changes that Latin America went through during the twentieth-century:
        from dictatorships and revolutions to efforts for reconciliation and preservation
        of memory. The course content will include diverse forms of art, including
        poetry, mural paintings, photography, testimonies, music, and novels. Equally
        important, students will be placed in bi-weekly engagement with a Latin American
        immigrant from the London (Ontario) community. Students will maintain a portfolio
        to keep notes, reactions, and thoughts about their conversations, class discussions,
        readings, and own reflections. Based on the portfolio, students will share
        one story with the rest of the class at the end of the term. Revolutionary
        movements: we will be able to discern, survive and keep growing in a large
        part because of its storytelling component, the sharing of experiences from
        mouth to mouth.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>https://commons.mla.org/deposits/item/mla:43</identifier><datestamp>2015-05-20T21:13:55Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc

        his discussion of Dante\u2019s Inferno, Edward Said writes that \u201CMaometto\u201D
        or Mohammed occupies the eighth circle in the nine circles of Hell, belonging
        to \u201Ca rigid hierarchy of evils.\u201D According to Said, \u201CMaometto\u201D
        is \u201Cendlessly being cleft in two from his chin to his anus,\u201D a punishment
        in Dante\u2019s belief is well deserved because of Maometto\u2019s sensuality
        and \u201Cpretensions to theological eminence.\u201D Such graphic description
        of torment evokes scenes of torture we have of late witnessed in Abu Ghreib
        and Guantanamo. Prisoners, not only, were subjected to physical abuse but
        were also subjected to acts of sexual perversion as was revealed by the photos.
        Furthermore, the latter showed those who partook in these actions seemed to
        be enjoying the power that the exercise of torture gave them. Robert J.C.
        Young states that Colonialism \u201Cwas not only a machine of war \u2026 but
        also a desiring machine.\u201D This poses the question as to whether torture
        does allow for the enactment of repressed desire by allowing it to surface
        by providing it with a venue in which it becomes acceptable. Moreover, does
        Colonialism in its previous or in its current form, only sustain itself fundamentally
        through constant violence, of which perversion is a vital component as these
        practices are playing into the repertoire of the evil East, or is the perversion
        an extension of a suppressed Oedipus complex?</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>https://commons.mla.org/deposits/item/mla:53</identifier><datestamp>2015-05-23T14:29:06Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc

        his seminar, Specters of Marx, Jacques Derrida discusses how one of the essential
        qualities of the specter is his ability to appear incessantly. The inability
        to know when the specter may appear, however, not only enforces its haunting
        quality but also conveys a despairing sense of what Derrida refers to as empty
        Messianism from which emits \u201Ca curious taste of death\u201D (Derrida
        169). Derrida also contends that with the empty Messianic wait lies the possibility
        of hope. In a number of Coetzee\u2019s novels, the characters feel they are
        possessed by demons or ghosts, from which at times they try to flee or control,
        as such presences summon memories of a past better forgotten or a future at
        best dreaded. In this paper, I discuss the roles of two mythological deities,
        Baal and Thoth that symbolically acquire the role of specters in Coetzee\u2019s
        The Master of Petersburg and Disgrace, respectively. In Coetzee\u2019s novels,
        these ancient gods, no longer assume their original mythical role, but instead
        evolve as premonitions of evil and death.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>https://commons.mla.org/deposits/item/mla:55</identifier><datestamp>2015-05-24T21:00:36Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc

        in partial completion for the Master's degree in American Studies at UMass
        Boston. Abstract: Between 1988 and 1994 American comic books engaged the politics,
        problematics, and crises of the AIDS epidemic by injecting the virus and its
        social, cultural, and epidemiological effects on gay men into the four-color
        fantasies of the superhero genre. As the comic-book industry was undergoing
        major internal changes that allowed for more mature, adult storylines, creators
        challenged the Comics Code Authority\u2019s 1954 sanction against the representation
        of homosexuality to create, for the first time, openly gay characters. Creators\u2019
        efforts were driven by a desire to recognize the reality of gay men\u2019s
        lived experiences, especially crucial in the epidemic time of the AIDS crisis.
        Through mainstream superhero comic books a small body of conscientious writers
        and artists confronted stereotypes and misinformation about HIV/AIDS, championed
        gay men\u2019s rights, and fought homophobia. Comic-book creators developed
        a complex, sustained, and lively conversation about HIV/AIDS, gay men, and
        PWAs that was unprecedented both in the history of comic books and of other
        forms of popular culture.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>https://commons.mla.org/deposits/item/mla:61</identifier><datestamp>2015-06-05T17:31:22Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc

        literature</dc:subject><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.17613/M6101T</dc:identifier><dc:description>With
        the discovery of the earliest known manuscript version of Et les chiens se
        taisaient, we learn that C\xE9saire had started thinking about the theater
        earlier than had been assumed, and most important, that he had originally
        envisioned this work as a historical drama based on the Haitian Revolution.
        \u201CMigrant Textuality\u201D explores the several versions and fragments
        of the play\u2014from the manuscript to its last authorial instantiation in
        OEuvres Compl\xE8tes in 1976\u2014in order to shed light on the author\u2019s
        troubled relationship with the history the play refers to and the historical
        circumstances of its production, and to outline a topology of the many migrations
        of text and documents in this monumental work. The first chapter reconstructs
        the genesis of the manuscript by careful analysis of the textual and material
        evidence. The second chapter grounds the first generic shift evinced by the
        work, from manuscript to the first published version in the poetry collection
        Les Armes miraculeuses, in the context of authorial responses to shifting
        editorial environments in the American hemisphere. The third chapter, \u201CLegology,\u201D
        departs from the particularity of the text to theorize textual blocks in general.
        The fourth chapter advocates for a form of reading that oscillates between
        macro- and microscopic approaches, using the topologies created in the previous
        chapter as proof-of-concept. The critical/digital work of the dissertation
        lays the foundation for a future digital edition of C\xE9saire\u2019s powerful
        poetic study of the radical anti-colonial rebel.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><resumptionToken>oai_dc.f(2016-05-25T00:00:00Z).u(2016-05-27T00:00:00Z):25</resumptionToken></ListRecords></OAI-PMH>"}

        history of The Cahier d' un retour au pays natal in English today. I use the
        early productions and reproductions of the poem to argue that C\xE9saire's
        early work is meant for an American (in the broad sense of the word) audience.
        Using textual evidence and archival research I demonstrate that the Brentano's
        edition of the poem is not an anomaly to be read as a different poem as has
        been argued before, but a central constituent in the development of C\xE9saire's
        poetics in the early 40s. The paper also provides a few more details than

        article explores building blocks in extant and emerging social media toward
        the possibilities they offer to the scholarly edition in electronic form,
        positing that we are witnessing the nascent stages of a new \u2018social\u2019
        edition existing at the intersection of social media and digital editing.
        Beginning with a typological formulation of electronic scholarly editions,
        activities common to humanities scholars who engage with texts as expert readers
        are considered, noting that many methods of engagement both reflect the interrelated
        nature of long-standing professional reading strategies and are social in
        nature; extending this frame work, the next steps in the scholarly edition\u2019s
        development in its incorporation of social media functionality reflect the
        importance of traditional humanistic activities and workflows, and include
        collaboration, incorporating contributions by its readers and re-visioning
        the role of the editor away from that of ultimate authority and more toward
        that of facilitator of reader involvement. Intended to provide a \u2018toolkit\u2019
        for academic consideration, this discussion of the emerging social edition
        points to new methods of textual engagement in digital literary studies and
        is accompanied by two integral, detailed appendices, published in Digital
        Humanities Quarterly under the title \u2018Pertinent discussions toward modeling
        the social edition: Annotated bibliographies\u2019 (http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/6/1/000111/000111.html):
        one addressing issues pertinent to online reading and interaction, and another

        2012\u20132013, a team led by Ray Siemens at the Electronic Textual Cultures
        Lab (ETCL), in collaboration with Implementing New Knowledge Environments
        (INKE), developed three annotated bibliographies under the rubric of \u201Csocial
        knowledge creation.\u201D The items for the bibliographies were gathered and
        annotated by members of the Electric Textual Cultures Lab (ETCL) to form this
        tripartite document as a resource for students and researchers involved in
        the INKE team and well beyond, including at digital humanities seminars in
        Bern (June 2013) and Leipzig (July 2013). Gathered here, the result of this
        initiative might best be approached as an expeditious environmental scan,
        a necessarily partial snapshot of scholarship coalescing around an emerging
        area of critical interest. The project did not seek to establish a canon,
        but instead to provide a transient representation of interrelational research
        areas through a process of collaborative aggregation. The annotated bibliography
        is purposefully focused on the active, present, and future \u201Csocial knowledge
        creation\u201D instead of the passive and past \u201Csocial construction of
        knowledge,\u201D in which its roots lie. The difference in emphasis signals
        a newfound concern with (re)shaping processes that produce knowledge, and
        doing so in ways that productively reposition sociological and historical
        approaches. Taken together, the three parts of the bibliography connect contemporary
        thinking about new knowledge production with a range of Web 2.0 digital tools
        and game-design models for redesigning knowledge processes to better facilitate
        collaboration.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>https://commons.mla.org/deposits/item/mla:87</identifier><datestamp>2015-06-25T01:36:22Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc

        the development of new research environments, hardware has often been neglected.
        E-readers have (reasonably) successfully been developed for leisurely reading,
        but reading with the goal of writing demands a different approach. This bibliography
        has been written to inform the INKE research group on physical aspects of
        digital scholarly reading. It consists of two parts: a hardware section, including
        a description of commercial e-readers as well as an overview of academically
        developed digital reading devices and a software section, also including commercially
        available packages next to academically developed reading environments which
        allow for flexible manipulation of text and other modalities; as well as reflections
        on digital scholarly reading. Combined, the two sections inform an integrated
        approach in the development of new research environments.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>https://commons.mla.org/deposits/item/mla:89</identifier><datestamp>2015-06-30T17:57:01Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc

        The Return of the Villanelle</dc:title><dc:creator>Amanda L. French</dc:creator><dc:date>2004</dc:date><dc:type>text</dc:type><dc:subject>British

        and scholars are all wrong about the villanelle. While most reference texts
        teach that the villanelle's nineteen-line alternating-refrain form was codified
        in the Renaissance, the scholar Julie Kane has conclusively shown that Jean
        Passerat's \"Villanelle\" (\"J'ay perdu ma Tourterelle\"), written in 1574
        and first published in 1606, is the only Renaissance example of this form.
        My own research has discovered that the nineteenth-century \"revival\" of
        the villanelle stems from an 1844 treatise by a little- known French Romantic
        poet-critic named Wilhelm Te\u0301nint. My study traces the villanelle first
        from its highly mythologized origin in the humanism of Renaissance France
        to its deployment in French post-Romantic and English Parnassian and Decadent
        verse, then from its bare survival in the period of high modernism to its
        minor revival by mid-century modernists, concluding with its prominence in
        the polyvocal culture wars of Anglophone poetry ever since Elizabeth Bishop\u2019s
        \"One Art\" (1976). The villanelle might justly be called the only fixed form
        of contemporary invention in English; contemporary poets may be attracted
        to the form because it connotes tradition without bearing the burden of tradition.
        Poets and scholars have neither wanted nor needed to know that the villanelle
        is not an archaic, foreign form. The introduction documents the current popularity
        of the nineteen-line fixed-form villanelle in Anglophone poetry and its absence
        in Francophone poetry. The first chapter focuses on Jean Passerat's \"J'ay
        perdu ma Tourterelle,\" offering a history, collation, interpretation, and
        new translation of this ignored original villanelle. The second chapter describes
        the highly politicized aesthetic context of nineteenth-century French and
        English post-Romanticism, when professional poet-critics The\u0301odore de
        Banville and Edmund Gosse claimed a false history for the villanelle. The
        third chapter examines the low status of the French forms in the period of
        high modernism and the Great War, discussing works by Joyce and Pound as well
        as patriotic poems. The fourth chapter explores the sources of Dylan Thomas's
        \"Do not go gentle into that good night\" and its influence on later poets,
        especially Elizabeth Bishop. The conclusion places the villanelle firmly within
        the context of contemporary professional poetry culture.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>https://commons.mla.org/deposits/item/mla:91</identifier><datestamp>2015-07-07T14:19:24Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc

        The Limits of Capitalism's Imagination and the End of Ideology\" analyzes
        the  post-9/11 U.S., a state of massive income inequality, waging endless
        war at home (the militarization of the police) and abroad,  within the context
        of two terms: \"Disinformation\" and \"ideology.\" The theoretical matrix
        of the essay distinguishes \u201Cmisinformation\u201D from \u201CDisinformation,\u201D
        and, centrally, Disinformation from ideology.  I define misinformation as
        merely a mistake in reportage that is typically retracted in the next day\u2019s
        news or a distortion of the truth, conscious (spin) or unconscious, for particular
        ends, such as the Bush administration\u2019s fiction of \u201Cweapons of mass
        destruction,\u201D which can be countered by information. On the other hand,
        \ I define Disinformation as a deep, historical process of erasing history
        itself. Disinformation is a radical decoupling of mainstream political rhetoric
        from reality such as \"the war on terror.\" However, as such, Disinformation
        is the opposite, or more precisely, the mirror image of ideology. That is,
        while Disinformation may appear to resemble ideology, it does not correspond
        to it. If, as Louis Althusser posits, ideology in substituting for reality
        still alludes to reality, Disinformation in its substitution makes no such
        allusion. Disinformation, then, approximates what Jean Baudrillard calls the
        \u201Csimulacrum\u201D: \u201CThe transition from signs that dissimulate something
        to signs that dissimulate that there is nothing\u2026.The first implies a
        theology of truth and secrecy (to which the notion of ideology still belongs).
        The second inaugurates an age of simulacra and simulation\u201D that \u201Cbears
        no relation to reality.\u201D While ideology offers a coherent national narrative,
        however mystifying, that integrates the subject, Disinformation, while simulating
        such a narrative, is fundamentally incoherent and disintegrates the subject.
        Analyzing texts that range from President Obama's speeches to Federalist 10,
        I argue that the U.S. is now operating under a regime of Disinformation, in
        which the ideology of American exceptionalism, while still being deployed
        by the two dominant political parties, is disintegrating.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>https://commons.mla.org/deposits/item/mla:101</identifier><datestamp>2015-07-10T21:55:32Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc

        autonomous cosmopolitanism is in four distinct layers. The first layer is
        her unusual everyday family background in the transition from Jewish tradition
        to the life of European revolutionaries in the 1840s and exile in Britain.
        The second layer is Blind\u2019s mental and moral development under Friederike\u2019s
        care and educational guidance according to the German concept of Bildung.
        The third layer comes from Mazzini\u2019s challenge for Blind to critically
        evaluate her German cultural heritage and the moral danger in the well-intended
        German concept of self-cultivation. Blind derives the fourth layer of her
        autonomous cosmopolitanism from Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution and Buckle\u2019s
        argument for a scientific approach to history. Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution
        by natural selection postulates sexual autonomy of the individual organism
        as a pre-condition for evolution by natural selection. Buckle\u2019s argument
        for a scientific approach to the study of history extends this concept by
        observing that the variety of geographical conditions around the globe gives
        rise to a diversity of cultures. The concept of social evolution is then anchored
        in the nature of interdependence between the individual and her society as
        it changes over time. Overall, my argument is that Blind\u2019s contribution
        to Victorian cosmopolitanism is to write about controversial subjects and
        to transcend ideological polarizations. She does this by transferring socio-political
        topics from the public domain into the intimacy of making \u201Can immediate
        sensuous contact\u201D with the individual reader. Her aim is to touch her
        reader\u2019s heart and to trust in her reader\u2019s ability and social will
        to care rather than to teach her about the individual poet\u2019s particular
        ideas of what should be done to solve problems.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>https://commons.mla.org/deposits/item/mla:103</identifier><datestamp>2015-07-12T02:40:29Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc

        American literature</dc:subject><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.17613/M6988Q</dc:identifier><dc:description>In
        this paper, I use Sandra Cisneros\u2019s /Caramelo/ (2002) to examine the
        \u201Ctraveling borderlands\u201D in Mexican American migrant narratives.
        Traveling borderlands names the aesthetic and existential practice of creating
        contingent home spaces that contest paradigms of fragmentation and essentialism,
        the former often taken to be a defining feature of marginalized identity and
        the latter often seen as a tactic of resisting marginalization. In defining
        these traveling borderlands, I use Gloria Anzald\xFAa\u2019s work to model
        an interpretive praxis that I call \u201Ctraves\xEDa hermeneutics,\u201D in
        which we understand the position of the artist (and also the depicted subject,
        if it applies) as mobilized and moving, thus unsettling her artistic and narrative
        authority in favor of a more horizontal relationship between herself and the
        people she represents in the novel. Using traves\xEDa hermeneutics, I argue
        that Cisneros\u2019s Caramelo articulates traveling borderlands as an idea
        of emplacement that offers us a mode of being in the world that moves otherwise
        than ideologies of essentialized or inescapable marginality. What we encounter
        in /Caramelo/ is a political and ethical challenge to unsettle ourselves along
        with the author, and in so doing, to explore new methods of creating space
        for dialogue with others. These intriguing, experimental dialogues suggest
        new relationships in and to the margins, thus surveying the possibilities
        represented by marginal identities and mobile sociality.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>https://commons.mla.org/deposits/item/mla:105</identifier><datestamp>2015-07-12T02:56:10Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc

        this paper, I propose that certain works of contemporary fiction offer us
        novel ways of imagining \u201Cforever\u201D that are specifically tied to
        momentary (and, often, arbitrary) acts of intimate connection. Considered
        together via their particular fashioning of \u201Cforever,\u201D Toni Morrison,
        Marilynne Robinson, and Karen Joy Fowler seem to offer a theory of the sublime
        that must to take into account the idea of impossibility as one of its primary
        modes of access. That is, by taking the fleeting moment and expanding it primarily
        through an act of imagination of the radical other, the three novels under
        consideration offer conclusions that conceptually and affectively render the
        moment into an impossibility that must nevertheless be incorporated into the
        totality of the narrative. In pushing us to consider these impossibilities,
        Paradise, Housekeeping, and We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves offer entryways
        for thinking ourselves into utopia, sublimity, and love as ethical concepts
        for moving through and conceptualizing the world.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>https://commons.mla.org/deposits/item/mla:109</identifier><datestamp>2015-07-12T03:10:26Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc

        Southwest is: an atomic testing zone, a paradise, a penal colony, a frontier,
        a mineral paradise, a fertile space, an arid zone, a forsaken wilderness,
        a region of mind-boggling biodiversity, an aesthetic haven, a brutal and ugly
        corpse-field, a mythical highway, the Devil\u2019s Highway, everything, and
        nothing. This paper begins as an overview of several narrative trends that
        feature the Southwest as a literary space. 20th C. Native American Literature
        of the Southwest has given nature a primary narrative place. Nature is resonant
        and enables a dialectics of self-discovery and healing. Anglo American Literature
        often sees the Southwest as a wilderness against which to encounter one\u2019s
        identity\u2014Nature must be confronted and overcome for both national and
        personal reasons. Chicano Literature asserts and celebrates the myth of Aztl\xE1n,
        and this paper will specifically consider the highly political and experimental
        Chicano novels of the 1970s. I will also briefly discuss the much smaller,
        but incredibly revealing and important African American and Japanese American
        literary contributions to Southwestern Literature. Ultimately, I argue for
        the importance of drawing a literary map of the Southwest that takes into
        account each and every quirk, turn, and contestation provided by the many
        narrative strands I will investigate. The literary topography of this unique
        space is one that we must continue to consider for the sake of collective
        identities, environmental safekeeping, existential exploration, and (inter)national
        politics for quite some time to come.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>https://commons.mla.org/deposits/item/mla:111</identifier><datestamp>2015-07-18T14:50:53Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc

        main topic of this article is the history of a rare and precious French magazine
        of the late Nineteenth century, in which a vivid and crucial discussion about
        arts and their inter-relation grew the more and more intense in the short
        space of four years (1892-1896). The \u201CLivre d\u2019Art\u201D was first
        conceived as a simple booklet to be distributed to the spectators of the experimental
        plays of the \u201DTh\xE9\xE2tre d\u2019Art\u201D, but it soon became a sophisticated
        art object, which merged figurative and poetic art in order to create a mutual
        relation of authentic correspondence among them, thus overcoming the wagnerian
        idea of Gesamtkumstwerk.\nWe are then going to focus on the second series
        of the Livre d\u2019Art (1896), that exhibits a new tendency towards Modernism
        and Internationalism, opening towards Belgian, German and English artistic
        and literary movements, such as Jugendstil and Arts and Crafts, but opening
        also to contemporary theatre aesthetics, publishing i.e. Jarry\u2019s Ubu

        the question of the role of empathy in our experience of fiction is currently
        an active one in psychology, most of the relevant research has been conducted
        on popular literature and film. This dissertation seeks to change that by
        using cognitive approaches to literature to examine how and why postmodern
        texts disrupt the reader or viewer\u2019s expected empathic connection with
        the narrator or protagonist. Drawing on research by both cognitive psychologists
        and cognitive cultural theorists, I examine first how this disruption is accomplished,
        through techniques of both narrative and ethical estrangement, such as: narrative
        unreliability or non-cooperation; mindreading puzzles that can never be solved;
        moments of intimacy and empathy that are deliberately thwarted; and the presence
        of the disgusting or the grotesque in the text. Ultimately, I argue that in
        the wake of the disastrous failure of empathy that was World War II, postmodern
        writers and directors have sought to render moral judgment and decision-making
        conscious and deliberate, rather than unconscious and emotion-based. Principle
        authors and texts include Gu\u0308nter Grass\u2019s Die Blechtrommel, W.G.
        Sebald\u2019s Die Ausgewanderten and Austerlitz, and Michael Haneke\u2019s
        films, Die Klavierspielerin, Das wei\xDFe Band, and Amour. This argument has
        implications for not only the field of cognitive cultural studies, but also
        for psychology, ethics, and education.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>https://commons.mla.org/deposits/item/mla:115</identifier><datestamp>2015-08-05T10:41:02Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc

        present essay will explore legal areas of Giambattista Vico\u2019s thought
        from a rhetorical and literary perspective. In particular, the essay will
        focus on the idea of \xABperson\xBB as it is investigated in De uno and New
        Science. The euristic quality of the notion of fictio iuris will be identified
        as generative core of the imaginative universal theory. The notion of legal
        person, made to stand for a whole collectivity, is a case in point. It will
        also be stressed the crucial role Vico awards to fictio iuris in the process
        that allowed ancient Roman law to tame violence while at the same time complying
        with the sacredness of its form. Vico\u2019s conclusions are supported by
        modern juridical scholarship, which collocates the birth of fictio as part
        of the development of sacrificial practice in symbolic direction. The tie
        linking fictio to civics is thus configured as poietic field open to verisimilitude,
        an horizon of possibilities that can be narrated and that humans will adopt
        in their infancy and employ through the long run of centuries.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>https://commons.mla.org/deposits/item/mla:123</identifier><datestamp>2015-08-05T14:32:19Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc

        Pericles over the Oxford\u2019s 1986 reconstructed Pericles, looking specifically
        at Act 3, Scenes 1 and 2. Gossett argues that Cerimon\u2019s \u201Crough and
        woeful music\u201D is not a scribal error in the quarto, a doubling of Cerimon\u2019s
        \u201Crough\u201D in 3.2.78-79, but perhaps intentional on Shakespeare\u2019s
        part. If we side with Oxford\u2019s emendations of these scenes, Cerimon\u2019s
        call for \u201Crough and woeful music\u201D becomes a call for \u201Cstill
        and woeful music\u201D; his admonishment, that Pericles was \u201Ctoo rough\u201D
        when he \u201Cthrew her in the sea\u201D becomes the insistence that he was
        \u201Ctoo rash\u201D when he \u201Cthrew her in the sea.\u201D In accepting
        Oxford\u2019s emendation, we lose the repetition in Cerimon\u2019s earlier
        admonishment. More importantly, we miss the fact that Thaisa\u2019s recovery

        Charles Kingsley's use of displacement in his children's book The Water Babies
        (1863). In trying to portray the site of moral formation, Kingsley displaces
        his central character Tom \u2013 the new, interstitial \u201Cthird culture\u201D
        subject. Through Tom\u2019s displacement, Kingsley strives for unity between
        science and religion, resulting in new social formations. The type of unity
        Kingsley envisions has its own discrepancies and ironically aligns Kingsley
        to Cardinal John Henry Newman's position on moral formation.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>https://commons.mla.org/deposits/item/mla:145</identifier><datestamp>2015-08-24T23:58:00Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc

        dissertation combines micro-history, literary geography, urbanism, and the
        history of the French illustrated book. I work outwards from Les Types de
        Paris, a virtually ignored and chaotically hybrid collection of essays, short
        stories, physiologies and poetry that I position as a latter-day rewriting
        of the panoramic literature of the 1840s. This iteration, I argue, has to
        address a city that has become unheimlich for its inhabitants. Post-Haussmann,
        post-1870, in the throes of an Exposition universelle: this has become a city
        in constant flux. The volume\u2019s contributors\u2014from Edmond de Goncourt,
        Mallarm\xE9, and Maupassant to Mirbeau, Richepin, and Zola\u2014collaborate
        with its illustrator-curator, Jean-Fran\xE7ois Raffa\xEBlli to try to make
        sense of a city whose social, gender, and geographical boundaries are no longer
        fixed. The resultant visual-verbal ensemble reveals a bourgeois urban class
        ridden with the anxieties of modernity\u2014from the increasing visibility
        and mobility of the working class, to a crisis of masculinity in the face
        of defeat, to the shifting social and geographical borders of the city in
        which it lives. Here, the panoramic format reflects the authors' desire to
        frame the fluid, to stay the tide of change.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>https://commons.mla.org/deposits/item/mla:161</identifier><datestamp>2015-10-19T20:01:54Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc

        other forms of treachery, translation can be either concealed or exposed.
        Though most literary translators work in the dark and some embrace invisibility
        as an ideal, all translations can be situated along the continuum of illusionist-anti-illusionist
        or domesticating-foreignizing. A variety of paratexts lay bare the devices
        of translation. The zero degree of translational invisibility occurs in utilitarian
        prose that is designed simply to convey information. But the minimal way for
        a book to make translation visible is to identify the name of the translator,
        on the title page if not on the cover and spine. A long tradition of translator\u2019s
        prefaces further undercuts the illusion of unmediated contact with a pure,
        primal text. So, too, do the memoirs of translators. Second-degree translations
        can both display and conceal the derivative nature of the final text. If there
        are reasons\u2014such as vanity or commerce\u2014to disguise a text\u2019s
        origins in translation, there are also reasons for pseudo-translations, texts
        that falsely claim to be translations. More than just an appendix to an Englishing
        of the Iliad and the Odyssey, Keats\u2019s \u201COn First Looking into Chapman\u2019s
        Homer\u201D is a poet\u2019s tribute to the power of translation.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>https://commons.mla.org/deposits/item/mla:169</identifier><datestamp>2015-10-19T20:38:12Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc

        an analysis of two post-crisis films (Estrellas, Federico Le\xF3n and Marcos
        Mart\xEDnez, 2007; El nexo, Sebasti\xE1n Antico, 2005) shot in the largest
        slum in Buenos Aires, Argentina, this essay sketches the terms for conceptualizing
        a cultural dimension of the Global South marked by the aesthetic reappropriation
        of poverty. Working against what has been called Latin America\u2019s persistent
        \u201Cmelodrama of poverty,\u201D and avoiding the type of cinematic representation
        that depicts the slum in terms of violence and uncertainty, the directors
        of these films highlight the fact that the reappropriation of poverty is often
        at the base of alternative forms of social and artistic agency. While the
        ability to work under conditions of material lack has long been an important
        dimension of Argentine artistic production, their films flaunt deprivation
        in order to transform precarity into an ideological and aesthetic weapon,
        re-staging social inequality in a spectacular fashion and advancing inventive
        modes of action. In this way, they argue that \u201Cmaking do\u201D can also
        become the basis for an alternative creative paradigm. In their exploration
        of this paradigm, which allows slum inhabitants to build a house in two minutes
        and create a spaceship out of junk, both films pose far-reaching questions:
        who has a right to perform? What roles are available for the people of the
        slum? And, what are the conditions for having artistic and social agency in
        economically deprived areas?</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>https://commons.mla.org/deposits/item/mla:171</identifier><datestamp>2015-10-19T20:48:43Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc

        upon studies of media history and print culture, this article analyzes the
        relationship among early-nineteenth-century Latin American periodicals, literary
        institutions, and new experiences of time and history. Framing these periodicals
        as a new medium which boomed during and immediately after the wars of independence,
        it underscores their impact upon forms of reading and writing, as well as
        their importance for concurrent and later debates on the norms\ngoverning
        literary institutions, including the status and definition of literature.
        Ultimately, this new medium gave rise not only to a new prose which was described
        as accelerated and therefore \u2018modern\u2019 but also to new forms of discursive
        authority and to an unprecedented legitimacy for literary genres such as the
        novel. As such, this article departs from the nation-building paradigms that
        have governed studies of the Latin American nineteenth century, establishing
        instead a dialog between periodicals of the whole region, with an emphasis
        on Cuba, Chile, and the Rio de\nla Plata.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>https://commons.mla.org/deposits/item/mla:173</identifier><datestamp>2015-10-19T20:59:57Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc

        light-skinned mulata passes for white and begins a romantic relationship that
        ends tragically, revealing the intransigence of racial barriers; a mother
        raises her biological daughter as her step-daughter, so that she might adopt
        a white identity; a multiethnic society is shaken by dreams and anxieties
        of social mobility: These are some of the traits shared by Ambarina (Virginia
        Auber, 1858) and Carmela (Ram\xF3n Meza, 1887), the two novels analyzed in
        this essay. While critics have tended to focus on the turning points in passing
        narratives\u2014e.g. the moments when what is supposed to be the truth is
        exposed, or when the disparity between the apparent and the real provokes
        a tragic outcome\u2014, I argue here that these novels elicit a different
        kind of reading from us. Even though passing acquires maximum visibility when
        it fails, or when the impostor is framed as such, its core might instead reside
        in a quotidian and active not-knowing or looking the other way, a phenomenon
        sometimes complemented by the existence of subjects who \u2018pass\u2019 without
        any intention to do so.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>https://commons.mla.org/deposits/item/mla:175</identifier><datestamp>2015-10-19T21:41:15Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc

        his theoretical writings, as well as in the subtext of The Waste Land, Eliot
        expresses the idea of the organic nature of culture and its unity despite
        its regional diversity. This unity is represented by some formal features
        of The Waste Land, such as its rhythm and structure. However, cultural unity,
        at times also represented by the textual, is opposed to the ideaistic disorder
        which disrupts the unity. This intricate relation of the cultural, textual,
        ideaistic, and formal, full of mutual inclusions, exclusions, compliances
        and non-compliances, adds up to both the ideas of non-being and nothingness
        of life, as well as to the ideology of order and (dis)unity. This duality
        of nothingness of life on the one hand, and establishing order on the other,
        is reconciled by means of the aesthetic unity of the opposites. The insistence
        on the aesthetic reconciliation of the above dichotomies, which Eliot sees
        as possible only in reference to the past, bears ideological traits common
        for many Modernist authors. The aesthetic of nothingness realized through
        the poetics of disorderly order thus leads to that what Terry Eagleton terms
        as the \u2018\u2018ideology of cultural disintegration\u2019\u2019. The aim
        of this essay is to scrutinize the interrelation of both Eliot\u2019s theoretical
        poetics and the poetics utilized in The Waste Land regarding the cultural
        and textual (dis)unity realized through the ideaistic and formal.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>https://commons.mla.org/deposits/item/mla:177</identifier><datestamp>2015-10-19T21:53:59Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc

        a new period of creativity, In the Wake of the Poetic explores the aesthetics
        and politics of Palestinian cultural expression in the last two decades. As
        it increasingly gains a significant presence on the international scene, much
        of Palestinian art owes a debt to Mahmoud Darwish, one of the finest contemporary
        poets, and to Palestinian writers of his generation. Rahman maps the immense
        influence of Darwish's poetry on a new generation of performance artists,
        visual artists, spoken-word poets, and musicians. Through an examination of
        selected works by key artists-such as Suheir Hammad, Ghassan Zaqtan, Elia
        Suleiman, Mona Hatoum, Sharif Waked, and others-Rahman articulates an aesthetic
        founded on loss, dispersion, dispossession, and transformation. It interrupts
        dominant regimes, constituting acts of dissension and intervention. It reinscribes
        belonging and is oriented toward solidarity and future. This innovative wave
        of experimentation transforms our understanding of the national through the
        diasporic and the transnational, and offers a profound meditation on identity.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>https://commons.mla.org/deposits/item/mla:183</identifier><datestamp>2015-10-19T22:39:52Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc

        article considers Mar \u0131a Lugones\u2019s concept of faithful witnessing
        as a point of departure to think about the ethics and possibilities of faithful
        witnessing in literary contexts. For Lugones, faithful witnessing is an act
        of aligning oneself with oppressed peoples against the grain of power and
        recognizing their humanity, oppression, and resistance despite the lack of
        institutional endorsement. I engage the work of Linda Tuhiwai Smith, Denise
        Oliver, and other scholars who offer methodologies and discourses on recognition,
        witnessing, and resis- tance. I argue that the feminist philosophical concept
        of faithful witnessing is a critical ele- ment of reading decolonial imaginaries.
        The article undertakes close readings of two novels in the Afro-Latinx and
        Afro-Hispanic tradition: Donato Ndongo\u2019s Shadows of Your Black Memory
        and Junot D \u0131az\u2019s The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao. In these
        readings, the concept of faithful witnessing enriches the analysis of religious
        colonization and the gender violence inherent to coloniality.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>https://commons.mla.org/deposits/item/mla:185</identifier><datestamp>2015-10-19T23:02:18Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc

        paper investigates the transnational intersections of queer Sinophone screen
        cultures in (South) East Asia, through a case study of the emerging film director
        Desmond Bing-Yen Ti. The discussion focuses on Ti\u2019s short film production
        and distribution in two Asian countries, Malaysia and China, and his engagement
        with online (queer) social media and video-sharing services in the trans-Sinitic
        and global flows of queer visual content. Putting Ti and his film at the intersections
        between queer studies and Sinophone studies, this paper also aims to further
        test and render problematic the theory of 'queer Sinophonicities' as both
        an extension and a departure from traditional queer Asian critique.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>https://commons.mla.org/deposits/item/mla:189</identifier><datestamp>2015-10-20T00:39:16Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc

        religion</dc:subject><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.17613/M6MG6T</dc:identifier><dc:description>Abstract:
        \n\nAssuming that the American self (and culture) was founded upon Puritan
        values, the aim of this paper is to discuss the importance of identificatory
        processes in helping to enforce conformity towards prevailing religious mores,
        as stated above, of a puritanical nature.  \nUnderlying our decision to focus
        the discussion on the novel Elmer Gantry is our belief that, as a novelist
        of manners, the author of Elmer Gantry, Sinclair Lewis, was particularly talented
        in the art of deconstructing many of the mechanisms used by the ruling class,
        the American middle class, to enforce conformity of the individual towards
        the dominant ideological, religious and social order. Contrary to the myth
        of the province as locus amoenus, an extension/enlargement of the myth of
        the farmer as the most honest and hardworking of men (whose forefathers were
        puritans, believed to be no less pious than their descendants were to become),
        popularized by authors such as Zona Gale, Booth Tarkington or Meredith Nicholson,
        Sinclair Lewis showed that the province had received the legacy of three centuries
        of ideological indoctrination and intellectual, moral and spiritual dilettantism.
        Having broken, after the publication of Main Street in 1920, with the prevailing
        literary tradition, Lewis demonstrates, in all the novels pertaining to the
        20s (including obviously Elmer Gantry) that white middle class Americans (of
        Anglo-Saxon ancestry), assume the role of \u201Csubjects\u201D maintaining
        with \u201Cthe other\u201D, be he an Indian, an immigrant, or even nature,
        a castrating relationship that eventually results in the puerile, neurotic
        or megalomaniac alienation of the subject himself/herself. \nThus, the trajectory
        of Lewis\u2019s hero Elmer Gantry can be analysed through an application of
        key psychoanalytic concepts, such as Melanie Klein\u2019s theory of \u201Cgood\u201D
        and bad breasts\u201D or the Oedipus complex or paternal metaphor, elaborated
        by Freud and recovered by Lacan, under the designation of the Name-of\u2013the\u2013Father.
        Accepting the Name-of-the-Father implies a perception of a denial, a lack,
        a prohibition, once the French word nom (name), when pronounced orally, is
        indistinguishable from non (no). Elmer, therefore, will commit a double murder,
        symbolically killing both his earthly and his Heavenly Father, so as to become
        equal to (or even replace) him/Him. \n\nKey words: \u201Cgood and bad objects/breasts\u201D;
        subject; other; introjection; Oedipus complex; The \u2013Name-of-the-Father</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>https://commons.mla.org/deposits/item/mla:193</identifier><datestamp>2015-10-20T00:53:27Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc

        influx of Vietnamese refugees, \u2018\u2018boat people,\u2019\u2019 and immigrants
        into the United States after April 1975 has led to the establishment of a
        significant Vietnamese-American community. There is a body of literature written
        for children and young adults that creates and delineates this new community
        within the topography of a welcoming and immigrant-friendly USA. This paper
        will examine the meanings and implications of the appellation \u2018\u2018Vietnamese-\nAmerican\u2019\u2019
        as defined within a body of nonfiction children\u2019s literature. It will
        highlight how these texts negotiate questions related to refugee status, immigration,
        identity and belonging,\ncontributing in many instances to a bland re-creation
        of a formerly oppressed but now coherent and increasingly prosperous and Americanized
        people. The children\u2019s literature plays an important role in defining
        the relatively new community to itself and to mainstream America. In its dissemination
        of truisms about Confucian heritages and stereotypes of \u2018\u2018model
        minorities \u2019\u2019 the literature reveals as much about American ideological

        have become enormously attractive to Internet users because they are open-access
        web pages or networks of web pages that can be modified by any interested
        editors, making them perpetual works-in-progress that evolve and change at
        the behest of their contributors.  Wikipedia, the limitless fountain of collected,
        and sometimes inaccurate, information, is now the largest encyclopedia in
        the world. Its popularity suggests not only that digital literacy demands
        participation and collaboration, but also that our current reading practices
        and information gathering are highly encyclopedic and reconstructive. This
        essay argues that wikis have origins in literate practices that predate the
        age of print, specifically in medieval encyclopedia writing. From Isidore
        of Seville to Honorius Augustodunensis to William Caxton, understanding the
        world meant creating and recreating its image, Imago mundi, in a language
        that would be accessible to more and more readers. Since students are using
        and misusing Wikipedia with increasing regularity as a foundation for learning
        in all of the disciplines, it is important for educators to understand the
        history of this collaborative, yet contested, literate behavior.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>https://commons.mla.org/deposits/item/mla:205</identifier><datestamp>2015-10-20T13:55:06Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc

        affect their 20th century selves.\n\nDana and Kevin adjust and readjust the

        explores the personal and public identities available to a black woman and
        a white man in two centuries. This paper, then, examines how Kindred borrows

        after the Second World War two Italian writers chose to look at the poetry
        of Joan Maragall. Montale\u2019s version of the \u201CSpiritual Canto\u201D
        has led to a variety of debates and interpretations, while the publication

        long time until rediscovered in the third millennium. The selection and the

        humanities (distant reading, narrative mapping, and sentiment analysis). They
        are aligned with the K-12 Common Core State Standards and informed by university-level
        DH discourses. Developed in collaboration with high school English teachers,
        these materials are designed both to support specific learning outcomes and
        to be adaptable for use with any course text. This curriculum is part of a

        the height of their popularity, performing animals appeared in over half of

        and, as consistent sources of novelty, to create crucial word-of-mouth interest
        in the bill\u2019s weekly line-up. Vaudeville\u2019s unique position as aspirationally
        middle-class, family-friendly and inexpensive theatrical entertainment in
        the heart of the city provided a forum for contemplating a diversity of domestic
        and wild animal bodies within an urban cultural context. With their fur, feathers
        and anthropomorphic antics, animal vaudevillians created \u2018discourses

        on Peter Brooks\u2019 concept of \u201Cnarrative desire,\" the paper seeks
        to identify and explore its applicability and manifestations in three of Edgar
        Allan Poe\u2019s short stories: namely, \u201CThe Black Cat,\u201D \u201CThe
        Tell-Tale Heart\u201D and \u201CThe Imp of the Perverse.\u201D Focusing on
        the role and nature of the narrators\u2019 confessions in these three tales,
        this article seeks to show how the need or the urge to tell, constituting
        a recurrent preoccupation in Poe, may be further integrated within a framework
        of psychoanalytic criticism in which the emphasis is shifted from either the
        author or the text toward critical reading itself. As a result, the paper
        draws attention to the fundamental ambivalence permeating the construction
        of these texts, between telling and concealing. These contradictory tendencies
        are placed within Brooks\u2019 theory of \u201Ctextual energetics\u201D and
        discussed in relation to his formulations on initiatory desire as well as
        the desire for the end, concepts which Brooks further connects to Freud\u2019s
        model of instinctual drives in the form of Eros and Thanatos.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>https://commons.mla.org/deposits/item/mla:225</identifier><datestamp>2015-10-21T19:18:57Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc

        white paper outlines a model for open access (OA) publishing for the humanities
        and social sciences (HSS) that offers a scalable, fair, responsive, and discipline-independent
        solution that can be applied to the entire scholarly communication ecosystem
        in an incremental fashion, rolled out at both small and large scale. The solution
        proposed here is one that encourages partnerships among scholarly societies,
        research libraries, and other institutional partners (e.g., collaborative
        e-archives and university presses) who share a common mission to support the
        creation and distribution of research and scholarship to improve society and
        to help solve the world\u2019s most challenging problems. Our proposal includes
        a plan to convert traditional subscription publication formats, including
        society-published journals and books or monographs, to OA; however, our ultimate
        goal is to present an approach to funding infrastructure for scholarly communication
        that is fair and open and fully supports new and evolving forms of research

        are needed not only to respond to the current funding crises in higher education

        and deepen the connections between the academy and the wider public. Only
        a model that builds collaborative alliances across a wide variety of institutions

        of Bingen and her visions were readily accepted \u2014 making it all the more
        significant that, despite the generally receptive conditions, Hildegard went
        to such trouble to make sure her visions and her writings were endorsed by
        the Church. In contrast, Joan of Arc, living in an era less friendly to mystics,
        seems not to have understood the necessity for the Church\u2019s endorsement.
        Nevertheless, despite the comparative safety or danger inherent in their taking
        such a course, both Hildegard and Joan chose to resort to mystical methods
        to assist them in their very public missions: Hildegard\u2019s preaching and
        admonition of temporal and ecclesiastical potentates alike, Joan\u2019s leading
        an army \u2014 both of which were roles the respective hierarchies frowned
        upon greatly. Visions \u2014 carefully orchestrated and sanctioned \u2014
        can help Hildegard to authorial power, but voices \u2014 naively employed
        \u2014 can send Joan to the stake.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>https://commons.mla.org/deposits/item/mla:233</identifier><datestamp>2015-10-21T22:43:12Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc

        Flannery O\u2019Connor\u2019s fiction has been subjected to criticism of all
        types and although she is known for her interest in religious matters, no
        one prior to this has done an in-depth study on the presentation of conversion
        in her fiction. With William James\u2019 The Varieties of Religious Experience
        as a basis for both definition and structure, O\u2019Connor\u2019s works were
        examined in the light of the conversion experience as it is broken down into
        three stages: a sense of sin, a state of exhaustion combined with a realization
        of the individual\u2019s inability to change, and conversion itself. Conversion
        can be either sudden or gradual. Francis Marion Tarwater, the protagonist
        of O\u2019Connor\u2019s novel The Violent Bear It Away, is the prototypical
        convert, going through all three stages and experiencing both types of conversion.
        O\u2019Connor cements her plot with pervasive symbolism, and both plot and
        symbolism combine to demonstrate her thesis that conversion \u2014 or at least
        the possibility of conversion \u2014 is included in every good story.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>https://commons.mla.org/deposits/item/mla:235</identifier><datestamp>2015-10-22T08:37:34Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc

        article reads South African science-fiction writer Lauren Beukes\u2019s first
        novel, Moxyland (2008) set in a futuristic Cape Town, from the perspective
        of Lindsay Bremner\u2019s notion of \u201Ccitiness\u201D-- or how cities produce
        the modernity of the subjects who inhabit them. The novel is remarkable for
        its dependence on the social geography of the South African city. This article
        charts Beukes\u2019s resolutely mobile focalizers as they negotiate the spatial
        itineraries and technologies of governance in which they are embedded. It
        explores how Beukes\u2019s futuristic urban setting fuses punitive forms of
        digital technology with the biopolitical regulation of social relations in
        an unsettling reprise of the apartheid groundplan.  My reading positions Moxyand
        in relation to discussions of African city textualities--a critical rubric
        introduced by Ranka Primorac in this journal--the better to explore how the
        novel makes history of dystopia.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>https://commons.mla.org/deposits/item/mla:237</identifier><datestamp>2015-10-22T14:49:38Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc

        true thoughts and motives by means of discretion, indirection, and outright
        deceit.  The theatricality of Commedia dell\u2019Arte, among other things,
        provided a way for the audience to briefly dissociate itself from and to fantasize
        about ways of coping with dissimulation.  A number of characteristics of Commedia
        dell\u2019Arte, including disguise, lying, tricks, spying and gossip, and
        portrayals of honor, previously seen as separate, cohere in the concept of
        dissimulation. \n\nNatalie Crohn Schmitt is Professor of Theatre and of English,

        paper explores how to choose literature texts which solve the dual purpose
        of teaching English skills (speaking, reading, writing and listening), as
        well as teaching students to look at poems, short stories, novels and dramas
        as relevant to their own life, full of characters who they already know and
        situations they recognize. I argue for the need of mixing Arabic literature
        in translation, canonical English texts and modern writers to created syllabi
        with texts that are both academically suitable and interesting for Middle
        Eastern students. To show the efficacy to this method, I will include examples
        of students\u2019 reaction to such syllabi. I will also include a brief review
        of articles about the challenges and benefits of using multi-cultural literature
        in the classroom. Providing texts that encourage students to notice universal
        human characteristics, whether fighting on a pirate ship in Peter Pan, dueling
        with a braggart in Cyrano De Bergerac or becoming, for ten minutes, the imperious
        Creon in Sophocles\u2019 Antigone, means that improvement in English language
        skills is matched by a wider understanding of humanity.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>https://commons.mla.org/deposits/item/mla:241</identifier><datestamp>2015-10-22T16:21:10Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc

        benefits of using literature in teaching and learning a foreign language are
        numerous. It not only embodies contextualized language, but also portrays
        human experience in breadth and depth and hence, through it, learners can
        be exposed to different cultures, with shared or unique beliefs, traditions
        and life styles. Given these advantages, and if used appropriately, literature
        can be a rich source of communicative language as it depicts actual language
        use in real situations. It can also be an ideal forum in which to develop
        cross-cultural understanding and critical thinking (Al-Mahrooqi, 2011a, Al-Mahrooqi,
        2012). This paper, however, asks if all literature is fit to be used in EFL
        contexts. In particular, it addresses the questions \u201CWhat criteria can
        be used to select appropriate literature for Omani EFL students?\u201D and
        \u201CWhat literary texts are considered best by these students?\u201D Further,
        the paper reports on an exercise in which Omani students reacted to some texts
        they had studied. The paper concludes by recommending fiction and non-fiction
        texts that have worked with students who are majoring in English at Dhofar
        University, Oman.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>https://commons.mla.org/deposits/item/mla:243</identifier><datestamp>2015-10-22T16:25:44Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc

        article considers the performances of \u201Canimal drag\u201D that appear
        across the affiliated US media projects of Jackass (the television program
        and film franchise) and Wildboyz (the television program). Drawing on transgender
        studies scholarship, as well as recent work in affect theory, animal studies,
        and environmental studies, Nicole Seymour argues that these performances\u2014which
        include, for example, a human inserting a fishhook in his face before being
        thrown into shark-infested waters\u2014constitute an extension of this media
        corpus's general investment in affective interconnectivity. As Seymour shows,
        such performances ask us to feel along with the performers, which includes
        feeling along with them as animals. Paying attention to the comic as well
        as the tragic resonances of animal drag, the article outlines the ethical
        role that nonserious affective modes can play in probing the trans-, or intersectional
        and interdependent, nature of human and nonhuman life.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>https://commons.mla.org/deposits/item/mla:251</identifier><datestamp>2015-10-23T00:03:06Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc

        colored spiral in a small ball of glass, this is how I see my own life,\"
        writes Vladimir Nabokov in his memoir, Speak, Memory. In our course \u201CWhat
        is Memory?\u201D we read and write with Nabokov\u2019s life story using our
        own form of Gregory Ulmer\u2019s \"mystory\" mode of writing as a way to discover
        the life cycles of memories--ours and our students as well as those related
        by Nabokov--and to explore their tendencies to constellate around images,
        objects, and their metaphorical relations--the spiral, for instance. Following
        Ulmer, our mystory is modeled after Roland Barthes\u2019 A Lover\u2019s Discourse.
        Like A Lover\u2019s Discourse, it is based on a \"tutor text\": A Lover\u2019s
        Discourse\u2019s tutor text is Goethe\u2019s Sorrows of Young Werther; ours
        is Nabokov\u2019s Speak, Memory. Like A Lover\u2019s Discourse, our mystory
        consists of a collection of \"figures,\" short open-ended compositions in
        which we write with and after Nabokov, weaving our responses to the autobiography
        with our own and each others' memories, including autobiographical and collective
        memories as well as memories of other texts. This \"weaving\" process is supported
        by our use of Scalar a multi-modal web-authoring platform, as the environment
        for our collaborative work. Coupling the responsive mystory mode of studying
        a memoir to the collaborative Scalar writing environment facilitates students\u2019

        women's perspective on liberatory Islamic orality (or empowerment via the
        oral traditions within Islam) is vastly accentuated in Fatema Mernissi's and
        Leila Ahmed's examinations of the harem structure. These harem narratives
        celebrate Sufism, a mystical Islamic theosophy that foregrounds orality and
        invites a constant search toward divine discovery and liberation from human
        limitations. Recalling these narratives, Morrison's Paradise (1997) emerges
        as a harem narrative that culls the liberatory Sufi rituals crystallized by
        Jalalu 'ddin Rumi, his lineage of the Mevlevi Order, and other Sufi mystics
        such as Mansur al-Hallaj and Muhyiddin ibn 'Arabi. Paradise celebrates Sufism
        as a paradigmatic vision for female resistance, empowerment, and liberation.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>https://commons.mla.org/deposits/item/mla:261</identifier><datestamp>2015-10-23T06:38:24Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc

        is a term used by Gilles Deleuze and F\xE9lix Guattari in their work, A Thousand
        Plateaus: Capitalism and Schizophrenia which at times can designate a movement
        towards denigration. With a \u201Cbecoming,\u201D a threshold is, invariably,
        crossed and the boundaries that have existed between the animal and the human
        become blurred. Moreover, \u201Cbecoming\u201D challenges an existing order.
        Deleuze and Guattari suggest that at times, it could function as a source
        of creativity. In this paper, I propose to show otherwise. This paper examines
        the process of \u201Cbecoming-animal\u201D in J.M. Coetzee\u2019s novel, Waiting
        for the Barbarians, and Jos\xE9 Saramago\u2019s novel, Blindness, and how
        this process invariably is one of degradation. This paper will also be discussing
        the issue of blindness and how in Saramago\u2019s novel it functions as the
        catalyst behind the becoming.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>https://commons.mla.org/deposits/item/mla:263</identifier><datestamp>2015-10-23T17:27:38Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc

        essay utilizes and applies the recurrent and pervasive taxonomic\ncharacteristics
        of the frame to the narrative of Toni Morrison\u2019s Paradise\n(1998), the
        third novel in her trilogy: Beloved (1987), Jazz (1992), and Paradise.\nThis
        critical approach avoids exploring the features of Paradise as a\nframe narrative
        by exclusively comparing it to another frame narrative.\nThe frame structure
        in Paradise does not develop through its similarity\nto some construction
        or specific frame narrative that belongs to a certain\nculture or period.
        Determining the frame structure in Paradise by its\nresemblance to another
        frame narrative would suggest that the sample\nframe narrative is a hierarchical
        and hegemonic model. To the contrary,\nmy analysis illustrates how Paradise
        emerges as an innovative frame narrative\nand how it adopts and adapts the
        taxonomic characteristics of the\nframe by employing inventive techniques.
        Concurrently, this study links\nParadise to the heritage of the life-giving
        frame narratives and accentuates\nits significant reproduction of the celebrated
        Arabic story cycle of\nAlf Laylah Wa Laylah.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>https://commons.mla.org/deposits/item/mla:275</identifier><datestamp>2015-10-24T06:16:53Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc

        chapter extends the focus of wartime trauma scholarship to recognise female
        non-combatants\u2019 variants of traumatic victimisation and agency, as presented
        in the Middle Eastern and African contexts. The agency of such actors, who
        suffered tragically from the traumas of war, was inexplicably overlooked in
        both Middle Eastern and African literatures and scholarships. Thus, my chapter
        rectifies this lacuna and presents the significant contributions of two female
        authors, Hanan al- Shaykh and Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, and examines the post-traumatic
        responses of female non-combatants in the war narratives of al-Shaykh\u2019s
        The Story of Zahra and Adichie\u2019s Half of a Yellow Sun. In particular,
        I readdress The Story of Zahra in light of Half of a Yellow Sun that revises
        the role of traumatised female non-combatants in collective change. I contend
        that reading traumas in both narratives propounds that traumatic recovery
        is never complete. However, the impossibility of transcending the \u2018acting-out\u2019
        of trauma does not necessarily entail the impossibility of the \u2018working-through.\u2019
        Arguably, traumatised victims may fail to entirely disengage themselves from
        the traumatic past but they can still be agents of change. As such, Half of
        a Yellow Sun exposes the limitation and the failure of The Story of Zahra\u2019s
        traumatised non-combatant in realising any social transformation. On the other
        hand, I demonstrate how both narratives construe narration and scriptotherapy,
        as modes of re-enactment, in relation to the inculcation of self-reconstruction
        and instigation of individual and collective change. My argument follows an
        interdisciplinary approach as it engages cultural studies, psychoanalysis
        and narratology in addressing trauma. Also, trauma theories by Van der Kolk,
        Dori Laub, Suzette Henke and Cathy Caruth are of substantial significance
        to this proposed reading.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>https://commons.mla.org/deposits/item/mla:277</identifier><datestamp>2015-10-24T16:28:25Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc

        on the grounds of testing Benedict Anderson\u2019s statements about this genre
        and its capability to represent imagined communities. This test is carried
        out from a cosmopolitan viewpoint. My analysis comprises three parts. First,
        I will briefly review Ulrich Beck\u2019s theories on cosmopolitanism. Second,
        I will approach Europeanization as reflected in new ways of reading, which

        since its introduction to China in the early twentieth century, spoken drama
        (huaju) has been at the forefront of social and political changes. Its realistic
        portrayal of life and use of spoken dialogue made it an ideal vehicle to promote
        social reforms and to serve politics. This study investigates the relationship
        between politics and theater in the People\u2019s Republic of China by focusing
        on a masterpiece of modern Chinese drama: Lao She\u2019s play Chaguan (Teahouse,
        1957), which chronicles fifty years of modern Chinese history from the demise
        of the Qing dynasty to the eve of the Communist victory. This essay examines
        how historical events are portrayed, how history served as a commentary on
        political conditions of the 1950s, and how changing political climates have
        affected the productions and reception of this play. It asks whether the new
        critical opinions of the past few years that question the earlier politically
        correct interpretation might invite new ways to stage the script.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>https://commons.mla.org/deposits/item/mla:283</identifier><datestamp>2015-10-27T17:53:56Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc

        article argues for an overlapping notion of indigeneity in Alex La Guma's
        In the Fog of the Seasons' End and Aidan Higgins' Langrishe, Go Down articulated
        using critical Aboriginal Studies while exploring the materialist emergence
        of identity. The key tension, then, is not between both authors\u2019 progressive
        politics nor the real differences between their Irish and South African settings\u2014the
        tension is the in-betweenness of their shared difficulty articulating a form
        of indigeneity and artistic expression that does not conflict with a materialist
        history and the theoretical precepts of their anticolonial visions. This is
        to say, both La Guma and Higgins work to express a metaphysical localist understanding
        of indigeneity while retaining the characteristically materialist notions
        of decolonization of the 1960s. Rather than a faulty logic, this understanding
        of colonialism and indigeneity is plural and reflects the \u201Cin-between\u201D
        nature of their experiences.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>https://commons.mla.org/deposits/item/mla:287</identifier><datestamp>2015-10-28T12:43:02Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc

        Egan\u2019s acclaimed 2010 novel, A Visit from the Goon Squad, is a text populated
        by a disproportionately high number of, often unfulfilled, postgraduate researchers:
        \u201CI\u2019m in the PhD program at Berkeley\u201D, proclaims Mindy; \u201CJoe,
        who hailed from Kenya [...] was getting his PhD in robotics at Columbia\u201D;
        \u201CBix, who\u2019s black, is spending his nights in the electrical-engineering
        lab where he\u2019s doing his PhD research\u201D; while only Rebecca \u201Cwas
        an academic star\u201D. Indeed, in this text, academia seems a place of misery,
        of \u201Charried academic slaving\u201D, and, ultimately, of \u201Cimmaturity
        and disastrous choices\u201D.\n\nOver the course of this article I will demonstrate
        that, in fact, Egan\u2019s critique of the university is an immanent meta-critique.
        While the history of the campus novel is often premised on hermetically sealing
        the campus (the genre usually functions through an explicit focus on a delineated
        campus space or, at least, predominantly upon the social milieu of the academy),
        Egan\u2019s novels seem to play on bursting the very notions of inside and
        outside that facilitate this genre, blurring the boundaries between fiction
        and critique; the leeching of the university into everyday life. She also,
        simultaneously, however, critiques the structures of labour upon which much
        of the academy is founded. While I will move towards Egan\u2019s latest novel,
        A Visit From the Goon Squad, throughout this article I will make reference
        to her entire novelistic canon, demonstrating that the treatment of academics
        throughout cannot be viewed as merely incidental, even if the appearances
        of such characters are sporadic and diffuse.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>https://commons.mla.org/deposits/item/mla:289</identifier><datestamp>2015-10-28T12:47:36Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc

        you work in a university, you are almost certain to have heard the term 'open
        access' in the past couple of years. You may also have heard either that it
        is the utopian answer to all the problems of research dissemination or perhaps
        that it marks the beginning of an apocalyptic new era of 'pay-to-say' publishing.
        In this book, Martin Paul Eve sets out the histories, contexts and controversies
        for open access, specifically in the humanities. Broaching practical elements
        alongside economic histories, open licensing, monographs and funder policies,
        this book is a must-read for both those new to ideas about open-access scholarly
        communications and those with an already keen interest in the latest developments
        for the humanities. This title is also available as open access via Cambridge

        in some ways, Sarah Waters\u2019s Affinity looks akin to historiographic metafiction,
        Marie-Luise Kohlke has persuasively argued that the text is more accurately

        potential of the form. This article suggests that genre play and a meta-generic

        mechanism through which Waters\u2019s novel effects its twists and pre-empts
        the expectations of an academic discourse community. This reading exposes
        Waters\u2019s continuing preoccupation with the academy but also situates
        her writing within a broader spectrum of fiction that foregrounds genre as
        a central concern. Ultimately, this article asks whether Waters\u2019s novel
        can, itself, be considered as a text that disciplines its own academic study
        in the way that it suggests that the academy has become, once more, blind
        to class.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>https://commons.mla.org/deposits/item/mla:293</identifier><datestamp>2015-10-28T13:02:11Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc

        This article sets out the economic problems faced by the humanities disciplines
        in the transition to gold open access and outlines the bases for investigations
        of collective funding models. Beginning with a series of four problems, it
        then details the key players in this field and their various approaches to
        collective \u201Cprocurement\u201D mechanisms. DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT The
        Open Library of Humanities seeks to instigate a collective funding model for
        an open access megajournal and multijournal system that should enable for
        a phased transition to a gold open access model that does not require author-facing
        article processing charges. Libraries who participate then have a governance
        stake in the platform. NEXT STEPS The project is currently working towards
        sustainability and launch. Authors\u2019 pledged papers are being called in
        and libraries are signing up to the model.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>https://commons.mla.org/deposits/item/mla:295</identifier><datestamp>2015-10-28T13:10:55Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc

        Bola\xF1o's 2666 is a novel that can be situated, aesthetically, within the
        traditions of utopian fiction and the North American encyclopaedic, postmodern
        novel. It is also, however, a text that is exemplary of a type of didacticism
        that cloaks its mechanism behind an overloaded structure. One of the explicit
        targets of this didacticism is the neo-liberal university that, in 2666, is
        structurally twinned with the police department and is thus complicit in the
        novel's femicides. This article suggests the ways in which Bola\xF1o's novel
        attempts to discipline the academy while also outlining its mode of crypto-didacticism.
        Taking theoretical cues from Theodor W. Adorno and Pierre Bourdieu, this article
        reads 2666 as a metafictional work that signals its own desire to teach, thereby
        representing a fresh approach for ethics in the postmodern novel and beyond.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>https://commons.mla.org/deposits/item/mla:297</identifier><datestamp>2015-10-28T13:29:39Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc

        piece effects a critical revision of the interactions between late Foucault
        and the works of Thomas Pynchon through the theme of Enlightenment, a relationship
        far more nuanced than granted by current appraisals. Examining resistance,
        revolution, and the critical attitude alongside a focus on the Foucauldian
        sphere of ethics, this work posits Pynchon's negative and positive utopianism
        as a regulative idea. Reading both Pynchon's fiction and his essays, particularly
        \u2018Nearer My Couch to Thee\u2019, alongside Foucault's two pieces on Kant's
        \u2018Was ist Aufkl\xE4rung?\u2019, it emerges that the divide between Pynchon
        and Foucault hinges more upon what we can know about ourselves and not necessarily,
        as has always been supposed, on who, or how, we can dominate. Pynchon's stance
        on revolution and resistance runs broadly in line with late Foucault's remarks
        on incrementalism; any change that can come about will, and should, be incremental
        while remaining pessimistic towards Meliorism. The narrowing of the sphere
        of ethics to ipseity that Foucault introduces to effectively counter the problems
        of agency that this entails, however, are not shared by Pynchon. For Pynchon,
        work upon the self is intrinsically contaminated and cannot be clearly delineated
        from the wider, impinging systems. With apologies to the author himself, it
        seems fair to say that when reading Pynchon in the Foucauldian Enlightenment
        tradition: we do know what's going on (to some, perhaps ingrained and inescapably
        limited, extent), and we let it go on, only ever imagining, in sorrow, how
        it could (never) be otherwise.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>https://commons.mla.org/deposits/item/mla:299</identifier><datestamp>2015-10-28T14:44:23Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc

        works of Ludwig Wittgenstein and the novels of Thomas Pynchon. This is broadly
        structured around three schools of Wittgenstein scholarship identified by
        Guy Kahane et al. as the Orthodox Tractatus, the New Wittgenstein, and several
        strands of the Orthodox Investigations (Kahane et al. 4-14). Moving from the
        earliest affiliation that Pynchon stages between Wittgenstein and Weissman,
        the underlying theme lies in Pynchon's relationship to ethical relativism
        as it pertains to Nazism. From this it will become clear that neither relativism
        of experience and representation, nor an unbounded relativism of non-committal
        ethics, are central to Pynchon's fiction.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>https://commons.mla.org/deposits/item/mla:305</identifier><datestamp>2015-10-28T19:14:10Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc

        is fairly commonly known, in certain circles, that open access comes in different
        \"flavours\". Besides the well-known adage of Richard Stallman that there
        are multiple types of freedom that can be divided into gratis and libre (\"free\"
        as in \"beer\" as opposed to \"free\" as in \"speech\"), the ways in which
        we provide access to material that is free in either sense are also plural.
        This piece, consisting of two parts, will give the historical backdrop to
        \"gold\", \"green\" and the lesser known \"platinum\" models but also frame
        these routes to access in the light of a failed utopian project that has been
        undermined by credentialist models of assessment. While May 1968, another
        utopian failure, gave us slogans of hope - \"Under the paving stones, the
        beach!\" - with open access publishing it seems the chances of finding our
        way back are growing slimmer, even if some hints of sand and surf shine through
        in the remaining admirable aspects of the system. The first portion of this
        piece will appraise the current taxonomies of open access arguing that \"platinum\"
        is a form of category error; a misplaced term that nonetheless signals current
        dissatisfaction. The second section here will think, practically, on the question
        of ?what is to be done?? In this second part, with reference (ironically,
        given the pragmatism deployed) to Adorno's theorizations of utopia, I will
        critique the conclusions of the UK's Finch Report as a document that neglects
        critical thinking, but one whose outcome may be dissent on a wide enough scale
        to trigger academic disobedience and revolt against the current publication
        system. From this I will lay out the three criteria that I believe are necessary
        for a transition away from \"Article Processing Charge\"-driven publication
        practices and the infrastructures that should be in place to capitalize on
        this dissatisfaction, including a modified Public Library of Science-type
        model.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><resumptionToken>oai_dc.f(2016-05-25T00:00:00Z).u(2016-05-27T00:00:00Z):125</resumptionToken></ListRecords></OAI-PMH>"}

        his article \"Queering Masturbation in Lorde's Life and Writing\" Eric Sipyinyu
        Njeng discusses masturbation in Audre Lorde's life and works to signal an
        important aspect of her oeuvre often neglected in scholarship. Lorde stands
        out among prominent queer queens by demonstrating theory corporeally thereby
        going beyond mere theory and positing her body as a space of complex sexual
        passions. When Judith Butler speaks of gender as performative rather than
        embodied, Lorde theorizes and foregrounds this in her works and self and celebrates
        a sexual matrix that ranges from heterosexuality to homosexuality to auto-sexuality.
        Lorde places masturbation between the binary hetero/homosexual options which
        privilege one form over the other suggesting that the hetero/homoerotic dichotomy
        is not transacted on a level field of emotional and analytical impartiality,
        but of homophobic pressure intent on devaluing other forms of sexuality. By
        forcing the third singularly corporeal option between the two, Lorde interpellates
        generalized homophobia and antimasturbatory sentiment which remain pervasive
        in culture and society.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>https://commons.mla.org/deposits/item/mla:311</identifier><datestamp>2015-10-29T10:04:27Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc

        to the structuralist era, to a moment characterized by belief in systems,
        structure, and the transparency of language. It argues that the scientific
        criticism of the present attempts to separate methodology from interpretation
        and in the process it has deemphasized the degree to which methodology also
        participates in interpretation. This essay returns to the deconstructive critique
        of structuralism in order to highlight the ways in which numerous interpretive
        decisions are suppressed in the pre-processing of text and in the use of machine
        learning algorithms.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>https://commons.mla.org/deposits/item/mla:315</identifier><datestamp>2015-10-29T14:23:16Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc

        essay focuses on the autobiographical strategies deployed by Ambrose Bierce
        in response to shifting conceptions of the literary representation of everyday
        life. I place Bierce at the transition point between nineteenth and twentieth-century
        realism, between an understanding of typical experience as comfortably generic
        and a growing sense that the common story has produced a horrify anonymity.
        \"Bits of Autobiography\" are fragmentary and hypersubjective narratives that
        Bierce uses in his attempt to re individuate by breaking with the repetitiveness
        that he associates with this latter understanding.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>https://commons.mla.org/deposits/item/mla:319</identifier><datestamp>2015-10-29T16:11:41Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc

        surrounding both authors have limited biographical studies, and their distinct
        prose styles limit their immediate affinities\u2014Durrell is known for lush
        writing and playfulness with textuality while Vassanji\u2019s terse and conversational
        diction is paratactical. Nevertheless, Vassanji provokes readers to make comparisons
        on precisely these terms, though he has acknowledged the unexpected nature
        of his suggestion\u2014in 2002 he delivered a public lecture on Lawrence Durrell
        in Ottawa, \u201CThe Boy in the Street: The View from Across.\u201D They are
        tied through the \u201Cfact of imperial rule,\u201D which neither could escape

        reminiscent of Vonnegut\u2019s Slaughterhouse-Five to present the horrors
        of war to a new generation.  I then show how she moves beyond past and current
        wars to present a frightening picture of future wars, televised and automated.
        \ Far from being science fiction, her vision reflects a very real threat;
        a session of the United Nations Convention for Conventional Weapons will address
        the use of fully autonomous weapons \u2013killer robots\u2014later this month.
        \ With this text, Collins exposes a new generation of readers to the horrors
        of past wars and challenges them to address the wars\u2014and weapons-- of
        the future.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>https://commons.mla.org/deposits/item/mla:345</identifier><datestamp>2015-11-09T16:06:50Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc

        William Blake means studying the event of history, the way history merges
        with and emerges within theology, politics and philosophy. William Blake\u2019s
        poetry has had a precarious relationship with history; his work resonates
        from very specific historical concerns and yet also seems to struggle against
        being confined to any formal historical scheme. Blake\u2019s poetry is, to
        quote Anotonio Negri\u2019s characterization of Spinoza\u2019s thought, \u201Cmonsterous\u201D
        (4). It has an \u201Cinternal leap that dislocates its significance onto diverse
        horizons\u201D (5). The monstrosity of Blake\u2019s poetry, its struggle to
        displace history, even as it is quite obviously part of history, makes reading
        and studying Blake a singularly uncanny experience. To read Blake, one must
        constantly find new ways to apply Blake, to renew Blake, to dislocate Blake
        onto new horizons that can be applicable to contemporary, and ever-changing,
        concerns.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>https://commons.mla.org/deposits/item/mla:359</identifier><datestamp>2015-11-13T21:48:56Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc

        Miller has been repeatedly portrayed as the epitome of stereotypical Western
        masculine heterosexuality and most forcefully so in queer readings of Tropic
        of Cancer. I contend something different. Despite scholarly failures to notice
        the overtly queer content of the novel and (even more provocatively) despite
        queerings of the text that oddly reinforce heterosexist presumption, Miller
        explicitly endorses and implicates himself in discourses of queerness. This
        article interrogates the tension between stable and unstable identities in
        theories of sexualities, primarily using \u201Cqueerings\u201D of Miller as

        an essay entitled \"Digital Blake,\" J. Hillis-Miller (2006) asks a question
        which dominates discussions of William Blake's relationship to New Media:
        \"[w]ould Blake have approved of the William Blake Archive?\" (p29). The Archive
        has itself been the focus of enormous theoretical reflection. The \"Articles
        about the Archive\" section on the Archive website lists 54 journal articles,
        reviews, and miscellanea that either discuss the archive or use its resources.
        The William Blake Archive has also been a major influence on developing the
        theory and praxis of what has come to be known as the digital humanities.
        An influential introductory text on the digital humanities, A Companion to
        Digital Literary Studies (2007), features William Blake's Newton print on
        its cover, as an apparent homage to the work done in the Archive. Furthermore,
        John Walsh's article in the Companion suggests that the Archive persuasively
        argues for \"the transformative power of digital literary scholarship to overcome
        previous 'technological and economic obstructions'.\u201D As a tool for scholars,
        there can be no doubt that The William Blake Archive has shown the centrality
        of Blake in debates over the future of digital literary study.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>https://commons.mla.org/deposits/item/mla:365</identifier><datestamp>2015-11-16T15:03:39Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc

        dissertation explores the ways in which several fiction writers from France,
        the U.S., and Latin America experiment with the form of their works in writing
        about traumatic experience, as they navigate the tension between a propulsion
        toward expression and toward silence. Some of these traumas are vast, as in
        Edmond Jab\xE8s\u2019 Le livre des questions (1963-1973), which addresses
        not only the Holocaust, but also questions of exile and identity. Others are
        on a smaller scale, such as Jacques Roubaud\u2019s Quelque chose noir (1986),
        Julio Cort\xE1zar's Los autonautas de la cosmopista (1983), and Macedonio
        Fern\xE1ndez\u2019s Museo de la Novela de la Eterna (1967, posthumous); in
        each of these works, the author grapples with the loss and subsequent mourning
        of a spouse. Finally, G\xE9rard Gavarry\u2019s Hop l\xE0! un deux trois (2001)
        and Toni Morrison\u2019s Beloved (1987) both address the difficulties of responding
        to more ambiguous, insidious forms of trauma perpetrated by an entire society.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>https://commons.mla.org/deposits/item/mla:367</identifier><datestamp>2015-11-16T15:24:30Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc

        with the renowned \u201CWords to Intellectuals\u201D (1961) delivered by Fidel
        Castro in the Jos\xE9 Mart\xED National Library and the creation of a state
        network of libraries, the library in Cuba was transformed into a cultural
        sphere saturated with ideological ambiguity. On the one hand, the library
        embodied the symbolic axis of the literacy campaigns and of reading as the
        catalyzing nucleus of revolutionary volunteerism and of the imagined solidarity
        among Cubans of different social classes. But the library also constituted
        the foundational scene of the enduring uncertain relationship between the
        state and intellectuals embodied in Fidel\u2019s directive \u201Cwithin the
        Revolution, everything; against the Revolution, nothing.\u201D In this context,
        the representation of the library in post-Soviet Cuban literature and film
        re-stages unfinished debates between freedom of expression and the social
        contract. Drawing on concepts from Foucault, de Certeau, and Benjamin, this
        analysis demonstrates that recent Cuban cultural production re-invigorates
        the library as a space of ideological negotiation in a period of precarious
        expectations and re-activates cultural conversations about social class and
        democratization; individual and collective ownership of cultural resources;
        and the revolutionary ideal of citizen immersion in cultural life.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>https://commons.mla.org/deposits/item/mla:373</identifier><datestamp>2015-11-19T21:46:13Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc

        Introduction to Pied Piper of Lovers. Durrell's first novel, Pied Piper of
        Lovers, was published in 1935, shortly after he left England to live abroad
        until his death in 1990. As an autobiographical K\xFCnstlerroman, it traces
        Walsh Clifton's Anglo-Indian childhood and his struggles to negotiate a life
        between \"mother\" India and \"father\" England. The trauma of leaving India
        for an alien home propels the novel's concerns with colonial life and its
        wounds, transitioning from an idyllic rural world to London and Bloomsbury
        in the 1920s. Pied Piper of Lovers draws keenly from Durrell's own life and
        charts the emotional experiences that would drive the rest of his career.
        For these reasons, Durrell never allowed republication, and the novel was
        largely lost in the London Blitz. Pied Piper of Lovers prompts significant
        reconsideration of the impetus and political tensions behind Durrell's late
        modernist masterpieces, The Alexandria Quartet, The Avignon Quintet, and Bitter
        Lemons. This new edition allows readers to reevaluate Durrell's complex role
        as a colonial writer in a postcolonial world by emphasizing his irony, privileges,
        and bitterness for a life always lived in-between.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>https://commons.mla.org/deposits/item/mla:377</identifier><datestamp>2015-11-26T02:45:07Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc

        Introduction to Panic Spring. First published in 1937, two years after Durrell
        took up residence on the Greek island Kerkyra, Panic Spring broke with the
        realist tradition in 1930s novels and shows the young author's first attempts
        to extend High Modernist innovations in rural and personal landscapes. Cubist,
        surrealist, and imagist techniques merge with rural life and the peasant village
        that an international group of expatriates are led to by a curiously Pan-like
        boatman. Unavailable for seven decades, this new edition of Panic Spring shows
        Durrell's emerging passion for Mediterranean life and the Greek world as well
        as his first attempts to articulate a political-aesthetic direction distinct
        from his peers, George Orwell and W.H. Auden. Under the shadow of financial
        and political ruin, on the verge of revolution and war, the one chance summer
        depicted in Panic Spring will make readers reconsider the impetus and interests
        behind Durrell's late modernist masterpieces, The Alexandria Quartet, The
        Black Book, and Prospero's Cell.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>https://commons.mla.org/deposits/item/mla:379</identifier><datestamp>2015-11-26T08:56:25Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc

        the gaps: fragments is a digitally printed limited edition of six fragments,
        four of which are poems that begin with my translations from early Greek thinking
        (works of Heraclitus, Parmenides, Sappho, and Empedocles). The fifth includes
        a poem based on my translation of a story included in Plato's Phaedrus and
        a hybrid piece built around Plato's Parmenides. The sixth fragment (again,
        a hybrid) is an imagined correspondence between Isaac Newton and Anne Viscountess
        Conway. One key strand of my work as an artist and as a scholar grows out
        of a fascination with the central place of fragments in the invention of \u201Cthe
        West,\u201D which, it seems to me, has often taken the form of putting fragments
        in their place and filling in gaps. I am interested in minding the gaps, and
        this collection is part of a larger project in which I set out to do just
        that. [This program partially supported by a grant from the Illinois Arts

        scraps and orts that survived Dietrich Bonhoeffer\u2019s imprisonment and
        execution by the Nazis played an influential role in theologies of the second
        half of the twentieth century, and that influence continues unabated in the
        twenty-first. Of particular interest has been his speculation on \u201Creligionless\u201D
        Christianity in \u201Ca world come of age,\u201D speculation that was formed
        in correspondence with his friend and colleague Eberhard Bethge. Despite Bethge\u2019s
        best efforts, that fragmentary speculation has often been read as a systematic
        treatise, with those doing the reading making Bonhoeffer a systematic theologian
        in their image by filling in the gaps to complete what he left undone. But
        the gaps are perhaps the most salient features of the paradoxical hope Bonhoeffer
        articulated throughout his life, with particular intensity after Hitler\u2019s
        rise to power in 1933. Silences are as critical as sounds for the articulation
        of this hope, and I believe that points us to two particularly important sources
        relevant to the questions posed by this conference. First is the lost treatise
        on time that may have been intended as a prologue to his ethics. This is a
        gap that would, perhaps, have been filled had the treatise survived, but its
        absence may prove more fruitful. Second is the turn he made to \u201Ccreative
        writing,\u201D first drama and fiction and then lyric poetry, during his imprisonment.
        That lyric poetry is the \u201Cfinal\u201D form calls Socrates (who, if we
        are to believe Plato\u2019s account, was also writing lyric poetry while he
        waited for his execution) to mind. Bonhoeffer\u2019s reflection \u201Cafter
        ten years\u201D suggests a turn from chronos to kairos that calls for lyric
        poetry, a turn, we might say (paraphrasing good news at the heart of Bonhoeffer\u2019s
        faith), because the time is right. This paper is a close reading of the ten
        poems that survived Bonhoeffer\u2019s imprisonment and are included in Letters
        and Papers from Prison. I read them for their insight into paradoxical hope
        at the end of time, which, I suggest, is exactly where we are and always have
        been.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>https://commons.mla.org/deposits/item/mla:393</identifier><datestamp>2015-12-08T14:15:49Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc

        poem reveals greater ambivalence about this sublimity than is apparent\u2014linking
        it to later American philosophic poems by Frost, Stevens, Ammons, and Kinnell
        that at once solicit and question natural plenitude. Furthermore, \u201CMonadnoc\u201D
        is historically situated, both in terms of the issue of prior Indigenous habitation
        raised by the very Abenaki origin of its name and as instanced the comparisons
        to peoples in Western and Eastern Europe made by Emerson in addressing the
        community of people who live among the mountain. The trope of the horizon,
        it is argued, is deployed by the poem to link its natural and historical cognitive
        projects in an overall contingency, though it also operates to show how Emerson\u2019s
        vision has been amended and elaborated by later, more explicitly cosmopolitan
        turnings. \u201CMonadnoc\u201D has been absent from the sustained historicist
        reconsideration of Emerson over the last thirty years; this essay argues that

        Rizal\u2019s novel Noli me tangere (1887), addresses to the old scholar Don
        Anastasio, better known as Tasio, is more than just an expression of curiosity
        when he sees the latter writing, of all things, hieroglyphs. Tasio is, in
        Rizal\u2019s novel, the one character who is presented primarily as an intellectual\u2014the
        chapter in which this episode takes place is titled \u201CEn casa del fil\xF3sofo\u201D
        (\u201CAt the Philosopher\u2019s House\u201D). Yet he is also emotionally
        aligned with local values and with the future development of a Filipino nation,
        despite his pessimism regarding the social, political, and even cultural present.
        Tasio can be seen, therefore, as representing the anti-colonial Filipino scholar.

        essay argues that greater attention to the significance of the material culture
        of print, especially in early African American print culture, shows how technologies
        of racialization emerge in conjunction with technologies of printed words
        and images. The stereotype is perhaps the most familiar case. In one sense
        it offers quick reproduction of legible text, and in another it of- fers quick
        reproduction of a legible social type. In the rest of this essay, I ex- amine
        how another technology of legibility, black/white dualism, structures both
        print legibility and racial legibility. This essay proposes that the material
        culture of whiteness in antebellum print culture participates in nineteenth-
        century racial formation by modeling how whiteness is to be seen while un-
        seen, providing the structural backdrop against which marks or types become
        legible.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>https://commons.mla.org/deposits/item/mla:399</identifier><datestamp>2015-12-16T23:48:09Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc

        dissertation examines post-Holocaust, Jewish American novelists that utilize
        messianism in their narratives to negotiate ambivalence about Zionism. Studying
        novels from the mid-1980\u2019s to 2013, I look at the triangular relationship
        between Jewish American identification, the Holocaust, and Israel, to explore
        major topics in contemporary Jewry and fiction, including the homeland/ diaspora
        binary, the Jewish American writer\u2019s ethical responsibility, the legacy
        of the Holocaust, the complexity surrounding Zionism, and the formalist experimentation
        of postmodernism. My study begins with Michael Chabon\u2019s The Amazing Adventures
        of Kavalier and Clay and The Yiddish Policemen\u2019s Union, and his use of
        the messianic figure, which works as a fulcrum to examine both the limitations
        of Holocaust art as a healing device, and post-Holocaust diasporic anxiety;
        Chabon suggests that this anxiety is exasperated by ambivalent feelings about
        Israel and a lingering hope in the actualization of the Zionist dream. I continue
        with Philip Roth\u2019s Israel centered novels, The Counterlife and Operation
        Shylock, and his non-fictional, The Facts and Patrimony, delineating how Roth
        both depicts his writer protagonists\u2019 progression towards Jewish collectivity
        and presents a template for Jewish American solidarity to Zionism. Roth identifies
        loyalty to Zionism with a Jewishness that is paternally engendered, and, in
        his rejection of messianic ideology, suggests that his model of Zionism can
        only exist when Jewish Americans critique Israel with honesty and complexity.
        My study ends with a gendered reading of Tova Reich\u2019s Israel novels,
        which portray the disastrous consequences of the collision between messianic
        extremism and the Jewish mother. Within that dynamic, Reich delineates Zionism\u2019s
        and Judaism\u2019s patriarchal origins and inconsistencies, and reveals how
        extremists exploit those patriarchal elements to dangerous excess. Through
        the novels, Reich tacitly advocates for a complete revamping of Zionism and
        Judaism that eradicates hierarchy and chosenness and that is aligned with
        Judith Plaskow\u2019s concept of feminist Judaism. Tortured Zionism utilizes
        post-colonial, post-Zionist, Jewish, gender, and formalistic hermeneutics
        to elucidate that contemporary Jewish American writers are rejecting a diasporist
        approach to Jewish American identity and are solidifying the importance of
        Israel in the Jewish American imagination, despite and because of the complex
        issues surrounding Zionism.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>https://commons.mla.org/deposits/item/mla:405</identifier><datestamp>2015-12-19T03:44:03Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc

        of the hardest concepts to teach first-year composition students is the role
        of authority in academic writing. How are young adults who have a limited
        social world view and older adults who have left school for several years
        expected to assert themselves with confidence? Equally, another difficult
        threshold concept for FYC students is the act of humility in academic writing.
        Student writers need to acknowledge their limitations if they are going to
        establish authority in their writing. In my paper, I look closely at four
        students' essays, examining how they venture and participate in academic conversations
        as they negotiate the role of humility and authority.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>https://commons.mla.org/deposits/item/mla:407</identifier><datestamp>2015-12-21T16:26:26Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc

        Whole: Susan Howe\u2019s Experimental Syntax and Its Processing Implications</dc:title><dc:creator>Davide
        Castiglione</dc:creator><dc:date>2015</dc:date><dc:subject>American literature</dc:subject><dc:subject>Linguistics</dc:subject><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.17613/M6J304</dc:identifier><dc:description>It
        has long been acknowledged that syntactic violations in poetry are central
        to the difficulty of a poetic text (e.g. Fowler 1971, Fois-Kaschel 2002, Burke
        2007, Thoms 2008). However, for all its merits, most of the work carried out
        so far tends either to be more concerned with linguistic theory than with
        literary effects (i.e. the generativist tradition); or, conversely, it treats
        syntactic violations as ancillary elements of broader contextual concerns
        (i.e. literary criticism). It should be the business of stylistics to map
        the uncharted territory in between these two approaches, explaining syntactic
        effects at a textual level. Yet, when it comes to syntax, most work in stylistics
        confines itself to a few canonical authors (notably Dylan Thomas and E.E.
        Cummings) whilst ignoring later developments of experimental writing (e.g.
        John Ashbery, Susan Howe, Charles Bernstein). The present paper aims to widen
        the purview of poetic texts open to stylistic scrutiny as well as to make
        subtler predictions regarding the relationship between types of syntactic
        phenomena and resulting literary and processing effects. In particular, I
        show how different stylistic strategies (e.g. the blurring of constituency,
        syntactic ambiguity, the avoidance of main verbs) lead to very differentreaderly
        responses. My main case study is Susan Howe\u2019s experimental poetry, whose
        \u2018incomplete statements\u2019 (Middleton 2010: 637) and \u2018asyntactic
        writing\u2019 (Quartermain 1992: 184) have called for extensive critical commentaries.
        I analyse the blurring of word classes and functions in a poem from the collection
        Bed Hangings (2001), leading to multiple garden paths and to a posited reading
        that de-emphasizes syntactic relations in favour of a coarse semantic processing
        guided by freestanding nouns and adjectives. I conclude by showing empirically
        that these parsing difficulties are reflected in reading times that are much
        longer than those for other poems with more moderate syntactic disruptions.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>https://commons.mla.org/deposits/item/mla:411</identifier><datestamp>2015-12-23T22:16:01Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc

        significant policy statements have articulated threshold concepts in FYC in
        the last decade, the most influential being the Framework for Success in Postsecondary
        Writing, an amalgam of the WPA Outcomes Statement and \"habits of mind\" research.
        Two collections of essays have also explicitly asked, What Is 'College-Level'
        Writing? Other collections have explored disruptors of the traditional setting
        and timing of FYC, including Hansen and Farris's collection on dual enrollment,
        AP, and IB, College Credit for Writing in High School. These statements and
        collections are at their best when they abstract the cognitive skills, academic
        competencies, and affective dispositions that characterize college-level writers,
        no matter their age or setting. Conversely, arguments that borrow their legitimacy
        from the ambience of traditional college settings and presume the first year
        on a residential campus is the optimal place and time for college writing
        (such as the 2013 NCTE Research Policy Brief, \u201CFirst-Year Writing: What
        Good Does It Do?\u201D) come across as defensive, territorial, and elitist.
        Fifty years ago, community colleges challenged these same spatial and temporal
        assumptions. Today, in an era of innovation in dual enrollment and distance
        education, it may be time to challenge once again the notion that there is
        a fixed point and time of entry into college-level writing. We may need to
        question the utility and accuracy of the \u201Cthreshold\u201D metaphor itself,
        and the single portal into the single house it suggests. We would do so not
        to bury FYC, but to praise it and ultimately to expand it.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><resumptionToken>oai_dc.f(2016-05-25T00:00:00Z).u(2016-05-27T00:00:00Z):175</resumptionToken></ListRecords></OAI-PMH>"}

        chapter offers a close reading of two cinematic cases, Andrei Zviagintsev\u2019s
        Elena (2011) and Govorukhin\u2019s Voroshilov Sniper, in order to demonstrate
        in a reverse engineering move how publically executed punishments of the late
        1990s were translated into quiet murders a decade later. This transition from
        \u2018punishments outside the law\u2019 to \u2018crimes without punishment\u2019,
        I suggest, is usually linked in Russian cinema to two important trends. First,
        the impotence of the existing legal system \u2013 the inefficiency of the
        regulatory functions of the state are often counterbalanced by the increasing
        prominence of networks of reciprocity and forms of loyalty based on family
        ties. Second, the privatization of punishment, the appropriation of extrajudicial
        authority is frequently achieved through the aestheticization of violence.
        The separation of moral issues from the distribution of force allows us to
        perceive violence as a \u201Ccommunicative phenomenon,\u201D as Birgit Beumers
        and Mark Lipovetsky aptly put it (2009, 63), that is to say, as an artistic
        device, as a structural solution which is called upon to restore a necessary
        (narrative) balance.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>https://commons.mla.org/deposits/item/mla:423</identifier><datestamp>2016-01-05T20:23:32Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc

        at least in part, for a cause in which many Quakers ostensibly believed and
        had previously risked a great deal for, the American Civil War was a time
        of great trial for American Quakers. Extending ongoing efforts to understand
        this complex period, the following essay considers John G. Whittier\u2019s
        mid-war poem, \"In War Time,\" and the peculiarity of its simultaneous appearance
        in the major Hicksite, Gurneyite, and Wilburite periodicals of the nineteenth
        century. Consequent of the singularity of its shared printing, Whittier\u2019s
        poem renders more legible the shared dilemma Friends faced when attempting
        to position their peace principles in ethical relation to the mass suffering
        of the war. Reflecting, while also contributing to, a major transformation
        in American Quakerism, \"In War Time\" questioned the ethics of dissociative
        pacifism, exhorting members of the Society to assist the Union war effort,

        Mueenuddin\u2019s In Other Rooms, Other Wonders is reflection of Pakistani
        masculinity in a metamorphosed state. A disturbingly masculine vocabulary
        frames the appearance and actions of the female characters. In contrast, the
        speech and thought of the male characters is minified in words of loss and
        regret. Their material ambitions and the resulting show of power, is put into
        sharp contrast against an increasing impotency within their personal lives.
        They are unfulfilled, aging or dying men. This collection of short stories
        has been commended for its candid illumination of a contemporary Pakistan.
        However, this paper aims to highlight the alternative theme that these stories
        contain by showing Pakistani masculinity caught in a paraxial state between
        colonial delineations of power, the subsequent rise of corruption in a postcolonial
        aftermath, and the resulting confusion about issues of identity. There has
        been a loss of masculinity during this process which is reflected through
        the metaphor of death. Rather than dejection about this state of demise, this
        metaphoric interpretation leads the reader towards hope of a positive rebirth.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>https://commons.mla.org/deposits/item/mla:429</identifier><datestamp>2016-01-07T14:42:07Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc

        this free workshop, children and preteens (age 8-12) creatively explore and
        expand their sense of self by thinking and writing about their life - past,
        present, and future. Group activities, games, solitary writing, and illustrating
        provide for a fun and productive setting.   Students will receive individual
        attention and gradually realize how easy good writing can be when approached
        cooperatively. By May 2016, all will have developed their story into a hand-made,
        well-illustrated, hard-bound book!\n\nInspired by the 826 National network:
        http://www.826national.org/ ), this workshop has been taught since 2012 by
        Prof. Julia Douthwaite, with the help of her former students from the University
        of Notre Dame students. In spring 2016, Anna Bourbonnais and Kirstyn Ruiz
        will be assisting. The workshop covers 14 weekly sessions, and they are held
        in a conference room of the Saint Joseph County Public Library in downtown
        South Bend, IN.  All supplies are provided; the only expense is the optional
        color photocopy of our group book, which is available at mid-term (approx.
        $12). Attendance is limited to 12.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>https://commons.mla.org/deposits/item/mla:435</identifier><datestamp>2016-01-07T19:43:13Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc

        Geertz\u2019s Verstehen/ Einf\xFChlen distinction, this essay begins with
        an overview of the travel writing and anthropological work about Oman, concentrating
        on the southern region of Dhofar. The author then situates Wilfred Thesiger\u2019s
        classic Arabian Sands (1959) within these two genres as an example of a writer
        who is able to show understanding for and empathy with his Bedu traveling
        companions. Thesiger\u2019s Verstehen is demonstrated through comparing the
        details he gives of Bedu culture with current manifestations. His Einf\xFChlen
        is shown through his over-arching concern for his companions and his respectful
        descriptions of their life, avoiding the typical Victorian condescension towards
        \u201Cnatives\u201D and the self-absorbed gushing of many modern travel writers.
        Using seven years of experience studying the culture of southern Oman, the
        author argues that Thesiger\u2019s writing shows a rare combination of accuracy
        and empathy which elevates his book to a model of both anthropological and
        travel writing.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>https://commons.mla.org/deposits/item/mla:439</identifier><datestamp>2016-01-10T17:18:39Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc

        cultural work of the western and its generic forebears has been, in part,

        in which players are rewarded for performing acts of colonial domination.

        vital that we understand the genealogy of the genres that underpin Eurocentric
        thought and inscribe fantastical, pervasive, and durable narratives of Indigenous

        totalitarianism. Khrushchev\u2019s denunciation of Stalin\u2019s despotism
        at the 20th Congress of the Communist Party in 1956 revealed the Stalinist-communist
        utopia to be a brutal experiment in institutionality and caused many thinkers
        and writers on the Left to withdraw their support, as manifested by a sharp
        rise in dystopian and anti-utopian fiction and commentary. The ensuing identification
        of utopia as synonymous with State totalitarianism \u2013 the dangerous \u2018grand
        narrative\u2019 of a programmatic and enforced approach to social organisation
        \u2013 was further bolstered with the rise of multiculturalism and identity
        politics, and their accompanying discourses of pluralism, fragmentation and
        social heterogeneity.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>https://commons.mla.org/deposits/item/mla:443</identifier><datestamp>2016-01-11T00:29:29Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc

        lieu of an abstract, here is the beginning of the article: In a recent discussion
        of modernism, Peter Osborne argues that the terms \u201Cmodern,\u201D \u201Cmodernity,\u201D
        and \u201Cmodernization\u201D need to be understood through their shared philosophical
        status as temporal constructions. The emergence of the modern within Western
        philosophy is predicated on a subjective notion of successive ruptures that
        distinguish the new from the old. Replacing an older understanding of cyclical
        temporality, since the fifth century the modern (modernus) (389) thus utilizes
        a linear, Christian version of eschatological historical time while exerting
        what Osborne refers to as a \u201Cperformative logic of temporal negation\u201D
        (392). In the nineteenth century, this temporal experience of modernity was
        formulated in Germany as Neuzeit (modernity; literally, \u201Cnew time\u201D):
        a new epochal concept unique in its linguistic reference to the\ncontemporaneity
        of present time (Zeit), as opposed to the preceding periodizations of Miettelalter,
        mittlere Zeiten or Altertum.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>https://commons.mla.org/deposits/item/mla:445</identifier><datestamp>2016-01-11T04:42:48Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc

        article explores what Gershom Scholem has called Herbert Marcuse\u2019s \u201Cunacknowledged
        ties to [his] Jewish heritage.\u201D At the core of Marcuse\u2019s vision
        of transformed, non-repressive social relations, I argue, is a struggle over
        time, which rests upon a distinctly Jewish approach to the twin questions
        of remembrance and redemption. One example of this approach is the temporal
        dialectic between alienated labor time and the timelessness of pleasure\u2019s
        desire for eternity, which underpins Marcuse\u2019s analysis in Eros and Civilization
        (1956). This dialectic rests upon Marcuse\u2019s reading of the Freudian Eros-Todestrieb
        dualism, whose phylogenetic reading of patricide has been read by critics
        as reformulating the biblical rebellion against an authoritarian Yahweh.\n\nI
        argue that we should read Marcuse\u2019s privileging of the Freudian Eros-Todestrieb
        dualism as tacitly redefining political struggle through the affirmation of
        a redemptive model of cyclical time, which responds to a Jewish apocalyptic-utopian
        tradition. I consider the ways in which Marcuse\u2019s later writings in such
        texts as \u201CLiberation from the Affluent Society\u201D (1968), An Essay
        on Liberation (1969), Five Lectures (1970), and Counter-Revolution and Revolt
        (1972) reveal the liberation of time to be grounded in the uncovering of nature\u2019s
        \u201Cerotic cathexis.\u201D Cyclical time thus offers Marcuse an Orphic recourse
        with which to confront the linear time of advanced industrial capitalism.
        In reading Marcuse\u2019s delinearization of time through a reformulated understanding
        of Judeo-Christian eschatology, I conclude, we are afforded a fuller account
        of the way in which time underpins Marcuse\u2019s appeals to utopia.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>https://commons.mla.org/deposits/item/mla:447</identifier><datestamp>2016-01-11T04:52:46Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc

        and global modernisms Over the last twenty-five years, the modernist canon
        has been significantly revised as theoretical and empirical interventions
        have emphasised its transnational and globalised patterns of connection through
        a range of disciplinary approaches. As scholarship has moved beyond Europe
        and the United States, the complex nature of modernism\u2019s sociocultural
        matrices has become prominent, and a re-evaluation of the private and public
        spaces through which modernist works were disseminated \u2013 from the publishing
        house to the continuation of private patronage \u2013 has developed alongside
        a reconsideration of the way in which we theorise such activities in terms
        of time (Brooker et al. 1-4). In particular, the Marxist notion of \u201Cuneven
        development\u201D has resurfaced in recent years as a model through which
        to think the overlapping simultaneities in different parts of the world of
        aesthetic practices, transnational dialogues, publication and dissemination
        of texts, institutional engagements and the oppositional, counter public spheres
        through which various modernisms emerged and were contested.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>https://commons.mla.org/deposits/item/mla:449</identifier><datestamp>2016-01-11T05:01:29Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc

        lieu of an abstract, here is the beginning of the article:\n\nBorn in 1976
        in Bermuda, Jon McGregor grew up in Norfolk and currently lives in Nottingham
        in the UK. McGregor came to literary prominence with the publication of his
        first novel, If Nobody Speaks of Remarkable Things (Bloomsbury, 2002). The
        novel was an immediate success and at just 26 years old McGregor was the youngest\ncontender
        \u2013 and only first-time novelist \u2013 for the Man Booker Prize long list
        that year. Shortlisted for the British Book Awards Newcomer of the Year, theCommonwealth
        Writers Prize and the Sunday Times Young Writer of the Year Award,If Nobody
        Speaks went on to win the Betty Task Prize and the Somerset MaughamAward in
        2003. This critical success enabled McGregor to write full-time, move out
        of\nhis narrow boat and give up his various part-time jobs; which had ranged
        from working in a call centre, a t-shirt factory and a post room to standing
        in a bear costume to advertise the new pound shop in Barnsley high street.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>https://commons.mla.org/deposits/item/mla:451</identifier><datestamp>2016-01-11T05:07:42Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc

        lieu of an abstract, here is the beginning of the article: What can today\u2019s
        politics and cultures teach us about subjectivity? Can postdeconstructive
        theorisations of subjectivity retain or even widen the spaces in which subjects
        that are no longer metaphysical or humanist might cooperate to construct new
        emancipatory struggles? Guided by these questions, this special issue explores
        the ways in which subjectivity is being constituted and contested in the early
        twenty-first century: it examines radical traditions in the light of their
        impact on contemporary subject formation and the challenges and opportunities
        that the theorisation of subjectivity faces in the light of globalised cultural
        exchanges and crossdisciplinary fertilisations, a dominant neoliberal politics
        and media, and emerging grassroots movements. Throughout, the question of
        what it means to be a political subject in the early twenty-first century
        is explored with reference to a determinedly leftist tradition of anti-capitalism,
        antiimperialism, anti-racism and anti-sexism.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>https://commons.mla.org/deposits/item/mla:453</identifier><datestamp>2016-01-11T21:10:45Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc

        and Marissa Meyer\u2019s Cinder</dc:title><dc:creator>Deanna Stover</dc:creator><dc:date>2016</dc:date><dc:subject>Young

        Meyer\u2019s The Lunar Chronicles is a young adult series of science-fiction
        retellings of classic fairytales. The series abounds with adopted or orphaned
        heroines\u2014Scarlet (Little Red Riding Hood), Cress (Rapunzel), and Winter
        (Snow White)\u2014but Cinder, the titular character of the first installment
        of The Lunar Chronicles, is of particular interest to the study of adoption.
        In her retelling of the Cinderella fairytale, Meyer dramatically alters the
        story of Cinderella\u2019s birth: rather than a stepchild, Cinder is an adoptee.
        To complicate Cinder\u2019s sense of belonging further, she was made into
        a cyborg as a child due to traumatic injuries and she discovers that she is
        Lunar, a genetically modified race that is on the verge of war with the Earthen
        Alliance where she has grown up. Cinder\u2019s struggles with identity and
        understanding her own body are made even more compelling through a comparison
        with the Grimms\u2019 \u201CCinderella.\u201D In both texts, the body (and
        the violence done to it) is a source of identification. In \u201CCinderella,\u201D
        the prince is able to identify Cinderella by the shape and size of her foot
        before making her a part of his family. In Cinder, after her true identity
        has been revealed to her, the medical scans taken of Cinder\u2019s body become
        a text through which she can begin to understand her own biology and background.
        In striking contrast to Grimms\u2019 \u201CCinderella,\u201D Cinder participates
        in the reading of her body; while Cinderella\u2019s point of view is silenced,
        Cinder becomes empowered through self-knowledge, both in regards to her physical
        body and her birth origins. This comparison of the creation of identity through
        reading and analyzing the body in Cinder and \u201CCinderella\u201D will add
        to the discussion of the psychological and physical repercussions of closed
        adoption, a system through which corporeal identities are silenced and minimized.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>https://commons.mla.org/deposits/item/mla:459</identifier><datestamp>2016-01-13T16:40:00Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc

        recent years, American Beat author Jack Kerouac\u2019s body of work has found
        a reduced role in the study of 20th century American literature, functioning
        primarily as a window into an aspect of Americana that has largely vanished
        with the proliferation of high speed roadways: the cross-country road trip.
        However, the widespread availability of Kerouac\u2019s personal letters opens
        the door to new interpretations of his novels, offering teachers of American
        literature both an intertextual approach to presenting Kerouac\u2019s novels
        and a clear example, through private letters, of the role that authorial view
        can play in shaping the Roman \xE0 clef. This article uses letters written
        by Kerouac to shed light on the authorial choices made in his novel Visions
        of Gerard. By closely examining the influences at work\u2014 including historical
        events, the reliability of human memory, familial pressures, and Kerouac\u2019s
        own guilt\u2014the novel can be viewed on many levels, including those that
        do not reveal themselves if the novel is studied in the absence of the letters.
        Using Visions of Gerard as an example, this article seeks to demonstrate the
        value of using Kerouac\u2019s letters and other private writings to support
        classroom study of his body of work.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><resumptionToken>oai_dc.f(2016-05-25T00:00:00Z).u(2016-05-27T00:00:00Z):200</resumptionToken></ListRecords></OAI-PMH>"}

        a special 2014 issue of the Latin American Research Review, scholars Jeffrey
        W. Rubin (history), David Smilde (human relations), and Benjamin Junge (anthropology)
        develop the idea of \u201Czones of crisis,\u201D or \u201Cspaces of material
        deprivation, exclusion, violence, and environmental destruction\u201D (8)
        in which \u201Cstruggles for rights, recognition, and survival are enacted\u201D
        (7). Zones of crisis appear frequently in environmental literature, and their
        representation figures in more general imaginaries of crisis, apocalypse,
        and dystopia, as well as occasional representations of resilience and resurgence,
        that recur in contemporary written texts, films, and digital media. How does
        the scholarly exploration of imaginaries of crisis (which are often portrayed
        as the product of conflicting worldviews), as well as those of escape and
        resilience (many of which involve retreats from Western, capitalist worldviews)
        benefit from methodologies that incorporate an understanding of epistemic
        location into discussions of \u201Cplace\u201D and crisis? I advocate for
        ecocritical methodologies for a pluriversal world, and in particular, ask
        how the integration into the study of literature and the environment of the
        work of proponents of decolonizing knowledge, such as Linda Mart\xEDn Alcoff,
        Enrique Dussel, and Walter Mignolo, might serve to advance environmentally-oriented
        scholarship and teaching. Methods for a pluriversal ecocritical practice,
        I argue, facilitate a sort of \u201CGoogle-Earth style reasoning that permits
        us to zoom in and zoom out on issues\u201D (Bennett, et.al. 37) in ways that
        reveal interconnections among imaginaries, worldviews, geopolitical configurations,
        and their underlying epistemologies. They orient practitioners toward a consideration
        of processes, relationships, and interplays of discourse, as well as the exploration
        of competing, overlapping, and intersecting epistemologies at work in cultural
        products that circulate in scholarly research, classrooms, and society at
        large.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>https://commons.mla.org/deposits/item/mla:471</identifier><datestamp>2016-01-13T21:46:46Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc

        purpose of this article is to refl ect upon the process by which two professors
        in Spanish programs at small liberal arts colleges in the southeastern United
        States developed courses with civic engagement components that enabled our
        students to engage with the local Hispanic community in meaningful ways. From
        the outset, we focused on what we saw as an opportunity for connecting the
        curriculum we taught to our specific regional context, which had been shaped
        by new immigration patterns that brought large populations of Latin Americans
        to our region during the 1990s. We also explain how our interactions with
        local community leaders framed our work in such a way that it grew out of
        a dialogue about shared interests and goals. In addition to offering details
        about our specifi c courses, we explain the rationale behind our efforts and
        elucidate the unexpected impacts that the inclusion of one engagement course
        had on our respective curricula and other programming at our institutions,
        such as study abroad.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>https://commons.mla.org/deposits/item/mla:481</identifier><datestamp>2016-01-15T23:05:54Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc

        three projects that she would take on if she were not now retiring from the

        and inter-disciplinary language for better describing initial interactions
        between Europeans and Indigenous peoples in the Americas, a language that
        acknowledges and radically revises our notions of so-called \"prehistoric\"

        How Literary and Popular Genre Fiction Relate to Folk Psychology and Folk
        Sociology</dc:title><dc:creator>David Kidd</dc:creator><dc:date>2016</dc:date><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.17613/M6MP44</dc:identifier><dc:description>This
        paper proposes that readers understand the social content of fiction using
        the same sociocognitive processes they use in the real world. Much of the
        extant empirical work on the effects of reading fiction on social cognition
        have focused on individuating processes, such as theory of mind and empathy.
        Yet, decades of social psychological work point to the central roles of other
        forms of social cognition, such as stereotyping. Distinguishing between the
        first sort of social competence, \"folk psychology,\" and the other, \"folk
        sociology\", helps to create a framework for making more specific predictions
        about the social psychological processes involved in and affected by reading
        fiction. Psychological studies of readers and other audiences of fiction are
        reviewed in terms of this framework, and initial empirical work to address
        related hypotheses is presented.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>https://commons.mla.org/deposits/item/mla:487</identifier><datestamp>2016-01-20T01:13:38Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc

        these remarks for roundtable session 253 at the 2016 MLA convention--titled
        \"An Interactive Conversation about Service Learning in Literary Studies\"--Elizabeth
        Goodhue examines an undergraduate service learning course on children\u2019s
        literature and childhood literacy that she taught at UCLA. The paper focuses
        on how community-engaged pedagogy benefits undergraduates as well as the K-12
        students at local schools and educational nonprofits partnering with the course.
        Goodhue describes assignments that ask undergraduates to connect their experiences
        tutoring K-12 students in reading and writing with historical and contemporary
        texts and with current trends in literacy education and publishing, such as
        the recent #weneeeddiversebooks campaign. Goodhue demonstrates how service
        learning can yield tangible artifacts that benefit community partners and
        simultaneously guide undergraduates to think creatively about the complex
        challenges of living in a globally interconnected world, and encourage them
        to recognize the importance of respecting cultural diversity in curricula
        and collections.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>https://commons.mla.org/deposits/item/mla:495</identifier><datestamp>2016-01-21T16:26:28Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc

        my paper \u2018Postmodern Chinoiserie in Gene Luen Yang\u2019s American Born
        Chinese\u2019 (2014, Literature Compass 11 (1): 1\u201314), I propose that
        existing scholarship on the portrayal of Asians and Asian Americans in American
        comics has largely focused upon racist newspaper cartoons from the nineteenth
        and early twentieth centuries and modern Asian-American alternative comics.
        There exists a small but growing body of academic literature on the depiction
        of Asian Americans in modern mainstream comics. In this essay I seek to develop
        the scholarship by analysing Marvel\u2019\u2019s character Hazmat (Jennifer
        Takeda) in the context of modern depictions of Asians and Asian Americans
        in American comic books and the postmemory of Nagasaki Hiroshima, and the
        Japanese internment camps. This paper is organised in two parts. The first
        focuses upon the ways in which Asians and Asian Americans have historically
        been depicted (or, in many cases, not depicted) in American comics. The argument
        includes an examination of the ways in which the Marvel character Hazmat has
        been written in relation to those stereotypes. The second half of the essay
        considers the ways in which Hazmat embodies (quite literally) the violence
        towards Japanese civilians during World War II, and the ethics of exploring
        the history of genocide through the superhero genre.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>https://commons.mla.org/deposits/item/mla:501</identifier><datestamp>2016-01-22T07:24:57Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc

        Phillips Lovecraft was an author, letter writer and poet who lived between
        1890 and 1937. His works blend science fiction with Gothic themes. Lovecraft
        was, by the majority of accounts (including his own), a bad writer. He was
        also an outspoken racist for the majority of his life to a degree which makes
        much of his work, to a modern reader, politically grotesque. Despite the above,
        it would not be an exaggeration to say that Lovecraft\u2019s work can be found
        in the genealogy of almost all modern science fiction and horror. This essay
        introduces the major concepts in critical responses to the fictional prose
        works of H.P. Lovecraft. The author examines the recurring themes of language,
        genre, literary influences, xenophobia, cosmic indifferentism, dreams, time
        and the influence of Lovecraft. This essay does not, due to length limitations,
        seek to be inclusive of all Lovecraft criticism, but instead presents key
        themes and works. Nor does it address the totality of Lovecraft\u2019s work
        and focuses, instead on readings of his fictional prose works.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>https://commons.mla.org/deposits/item/mla:509</identifier><datestamp>2016-01-22T07:44:50Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc

        all scholars who work on medieval or early modern texts at some point work
        from digital facsimiles. There are advantages and disadvantages to such objects:
        what they might offer in terms of convenience and availability, they lack
        in material information. We can adjust the nature of what questions we ask
        of which object, consulting digital facsimiles for some uses, and manuscripts
        and print for others. But we also need to recognize that digital facsimiles
        are objects in and of themselves\u2014they are not surrogates, but primary
        sources for our research. In this paper, I will explore the terms through
        which we can discuss digitizations as primary sources, argue for the importance
        of recognizing them as such, and outline a series of questions we can ask
        of the images and platforms we use to identify and interrogate them as sources
        in their own right.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>https://commons.mla.org/deposits/item/mla:517</identifier><datestamp>2016-01-22T16:02:47Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc

        Lady Lovelace is recognized as the first computer programmer \u2013 for an
        algorithm she co-authored with inventor Charles Babbage in 1843. She has also
        become, per biographer Betty Toole, a \u201Cmodern myth,\u201D whose very
        ambiguity and otherness encourage readers\u2019 self-invention around gender
        and tech, human-machine interactions, and female sexuality. Her life has inspired
        an eclectic cultural afterlife, ranging from operas and plays to steampunk
        fashion and even an eponymous underwear collection. One such contemporary
        artifact is Sydney Padua\u2019s web comic \u201C2-D Goggles,\u201D which playfully
        re-imagines Lovelace and Babbage as a Victorian crime-fighting duo. This paper
        examines how Padua\u2019s comic both comments on \u2013 and creates \u2013
        new publics around Lovelace. Despite its fictional premise, the comic blurs
        the lines between fantasy and biography, grounding its plots and dialogue
        in primary documents. Through its recursive structure \u2013 the feedback
        loop between Padua\u2019s panels and hypertextual footnotes \u2013 \u201C2-D
        Goggles\u201D reveals the processes by which contemporary publics have shaped
        Lovelace\u2019s story. At the same time, its form has an invitational quality,
        engaging readers in an emergent act of (auto)biographical discovery. Padua\u2019s
        work ultimately illuminates broader questions about comics, life writing,
        and reading publics. Why is the comics medium so adept at immersing readers
        in life-writing practices, at linking an individual life with a collective
        story? What makes certain lives conducive to generating new publics? Does
        Ada\u2019s anachronism, her lack of fit with her own time, make her paradoxically
        a more resonant figure in ours?</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>https://commons.mla.org/deposits/item/mla:533</identifier><datestamp>2016-01-29T08:34:34Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc

        question of subtitling has received little attention in Film Studies, despite
        being the primary means by which foreign-language cinema is experienced. Current
        literature focuses on important matters of language and translation, but there
        are other aspects that exceed these matters when we watch subtitled films,
        aspects which are able to affect and move viewers without relying on explanation
        through translation. My paper shows how viewers have to negotiate these affective
        elements in order to apprehend foreign-language films, with special attention
        on their indeterminate characteristics that escape representation. It considers
        the negotiation of subtitled cinema from numerous theoretical perspectives.
        Gilles Deleuze\u2019s film-philosophy is popular in Film Studies for its theoretical
        flows and lines of flight, but this paper engages another Deleuzian thread\u2014one
        of gaps and fissure\u2014in order to explore the indeterminate negotiations
        of subtitled films. But in thinking about subtitling, we also have to reconsider
        the constitution of media. Cinema is not just made up of individual parts;
        rather, it is made of many interacting media, which cannot be separated. I
        argue that subtitled cinema consists of multiple affective elements that go
        beyond the interpretive methods of language and translation, and that the
        practice of negotiation is one way to apprehend them. In conclusion, this
        article, by exploring non-linguistic issues, argues that subtitling is not
        simply supplementary to cinema.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>https://commons.mla.org/deposits/item/mla:535</identifier><datestamp>2016-01-29T20:44:30Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc

        fiction,\u201D one which is invested in imagining a transnational and global
        community, in order to initiate a new analytical framework for South Asian
        diasporic literature. I argue that this critical framework not only challenges
        the notion of literary canons and classifications which consolidate national
        identity, but also offers a critical recognition of the South Asian diaspora
        in the United States by re-envisioning an American identity that is responsive
        to an age of migration, mobility, and transnational connections.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>https://commons.mla.org/deposits/item/mla:551</identifier><datestamp>2016-02-03T17:22:22Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc

        identity and French language. On auto-translation of the novel Le pain des
        corbeaux by Lhoussain Azergui The main problem discussed in the article is
        the meaning of the decision taken by Lhoussain Azergui who, after having engaged
        in the process of revitalization, finally opted by translating into French
        his novel originally written in Amazigh. The phenomenon of the emergent Amazigh
        literature can be understood in the perspective of trans-colonial renegotiation
        of Maghrebian identities. With Azergui, it enters a new field of experimentation,
        when the linguistic fidelity is broken to let the writer confront himself
        with a major literary language. It is a \u201Cbetrayal with a promise of return\u201D
        that can lead to a new stage in the development of Amazigh culture. Azergui\u2019s
        novel justifies internally the option of translation. Its main subject is
        the necessity of crossing the borders of traditional mentality. The hero,
        a journalist leaving the prison, finds no place in his own community due to
        the ancestral believes considering writing as a magical gesture. The traditional
        culture finds the hero guilty of supreme transgression, which is punishable
        by death. The intellectual rejected by his own community has no other option
        than to seek alliances in the outside world, hoping to efface the frontiers
        between the local and the global. Keywords: Maghreb, Amazigh, francophone
        literature, identity, Lhoussain Azergui.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>https://commons.mla.org/deposits/item/mla:557</identifier><datestamp>2016-02-05T19:51:38Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc

        Portugal, the possibility of being. Virtual universalism as the result of
        the process of cultural self- mythification. The article is divided in four
        parts. The first one contains the working hypothesis, associating Mensagem
        by Fernando Pessoa, the culminating formulation of the Portuguese self-mythification,
        with the trauma of Atlantic expansion. In the second part, Mensagem is analyzed
        as an emblema triplex, an initiatic poem revealing the secrets of the national
        destiny inscribed in heraldry. In the third part, Pessoa appears as supra-Cam\xF5es,
        completing the legitimization of the maritime expansion. Portuguese self-mythification
        is interpreted as a process of contamination between the secular, nationalistic
        logic and the religious one. Portugal becomes a universal empire of \u201Cthe
        law of eternal life\u201D. Its existence is nonetheless presented as virtual,
        unfulfilled, yet-to-come. The conclusions in the fourth part introduce a post-colonial
        perspective, showing the persistence of the virtual universalism in the lusophone
        discourse. Key-words: Portuguese identity \u2013 Fernando Pessoa \u2013 universalism

        away from the \u201Cartsy post-modern lefty-pinko university\u201D. \nNoor's
        transcultural experience and the duties of the intellectual.\n\nThe volume
        Qur'an and cricket consists of several travelogues produced by a Malay intellectual,
        Farish A. Noor, during his trips to the most problematic places of the world,
        marked by the contemporary \u201Cbattles of God\u201D. This book is interpreted
        in terms of a quest for transcultural condition understood as a dimension
        of experience transcending the multiplicity of cultural orders in dissent.
        \nNoor sketches his own definition of the intellectual, contrasted in this
        article with the visions given by Gramsci, Adorno and Said. The subject of
        the transcultural condition is defined as \u201Citinerant scholar\u201D transgressing
        the limitations of the academia by his nomadic immersion in the world. The
        attitude of the traveller is marked by openness and readiness to listen, even
        if he is confronted to irrational mumbling. Precisely the mumbling of anger
        and hate becomes the most difficult challenge to the intellectual unable to
        deal with it rationally. The only remaining answer is a sheer presence and
        love, emotional attachment to the world, as the scholar rejects the temptation
        of the ivory tower that would isolate him from the otherness. The modality
        of speech that opposes the hateful mumbling isn't based on clear, persuasive
        argumentation, but on ironic ambivalence conjugated with directness and the
        rejection of euphemism. Most importantly, the \u201Citinerant scholar\u201D
        is not a preacher. \nIn opposition to the leftist tradition of defining the
        intellectual as a secular figure, the \u201Citinerant scholar\u201D remains
        deeply immersed in religion. The challenge of building up the transcultural
        dimension is connected to the necessity of finding a place for the authentic
        religious experience in times of \u201Cbattles of God\u201D. \n\n\nKey words:\n\nFarish

        There Tunisian Literature? Emergent Writing and Fractal Proliferation of Minor
        Voices.\nThe article presents the Tunisian literature from the non-local perspective
        of the global literary market and the circulation of translated literature.
        The minor status of the studied phenomenon becomes obvious even when the Tunisian
        literature is compared with the Moroccan one. What is more, this comparison
        helps to understand the consequences of some choices made by the Tunisian
        writers, choices that established diverging directions of literary quest and
        caused the ambivalent aspiration of belonging both to the Arabic and the French
        linguistic and cultural zone. This basic ambivalence is treated in the article
        as an essential fissure and a kind of fractal principle, conducing to the
        proliferation of minor voices, instead of synergistic pattern of development
        leading to the synthesis of cultural contradictions. Some of these voices,
        such as Abdelwahab Meddeb, try to inscribe themselves in the universalist,
        gallicized context, while others, such as the emigrant Arab-speaking writer
        Hassouna Mosbahi, find in the translation a chance of reaching new readers
        and the promise of escaping the status of minor or emergent writers.\nKey

        pp. 151-52:] \"Not only do we ourselves treat fictional characters as if they
        were capable of a broad variety of mental states (as real people are) to make
        sense of the story when we first read it; not only do we casually refer to
        these characters\u2019 and the author\u2019s mental states in our subsequent
        discussions with students; not only do we introduce more \u201Cpeople\u201D
        into our conversation, such as Freud, Derrida, and Marx, and talk about them
        as if we know what they would think about the text; but we also cannot produce
        a single interpretation of the text without constructing ever more elaborate
        and/or surprising attributions of thoughts, feelings, and intentions. Every
        single one of our exegeses involves attribution and interpretation of mental
        states, and none of our classroom conversations or scholarly publications
        would be practicable if we had to stop every minute and issue a disclaimer
        to the effect that we seem to be talking about real minds but we are really
        talking about fictional constructs. What all this adds up to is that the cognitive
        perspective on fictional interiorities commits us, more than any other theoretical
        perspective, to historicizing.\"</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><resumptionToken>oai_dc.f(2016-05-25T00:00:00Z).u(2016-05-27T00:00:00Z):250</resumptionToken></ListRecords></OAI-PMH>"}

        media theorists have begun to rethink the material basis of media in light
        of \u2018new materialist\u2019 thought. This involves expanding the concept
        of media to include the temporal and indeterminate processes involved. The
        process of mediation, rather than stable media objects, emerges as the point
        of departure. The basic claim of this essay is that media theory\u2019s recent
        embrace of material forces and practices should not take place as refusal
        of representation. The critical context of new materialism, which concerns
        the instability between objects and their representation, has led some media
        theorists to reconsider the relation between media theory and its objects
        of study in the world. This takes place in some cases in the name of a performativity
        of method\u2014an appeal to the creative, practical, and material forces of
        media-theoretical research that reconceives the theory-world relation in these
        terms. Metaphor, the rhetorical transfer of meaning from one term to another,
        and usually understood as supplemental, can also be conceived as a material
        process of mediation, if we think in terms of a new materialist perspective.
        Thinking about metaphor in this way allows us to carry new materialism\u2019s
        important insights on materiality, meaning, mediation and method further.

        this essay, I follow debates about forms and sites of memorialization in post-
        Soviet Belarus. Begun during perestroika, the public discussions about Khatyn\u2019
        and Kuropaty eventually evolved into persistent attempts to realign the Soviet
        past along new narrative axes. Most prominently, this discursive reformatting
        of the socialist experience was reflected in various gestures of withdrawal
        and distancing. I suggest that these discursive and mnemonic moves\u2014from
        commemorating victims to memorializing victimhood\u2014could be seen as signs
        of the emergence and development of postcolonial reasoning in post- Soviet
        Belarus. The postcolonial estrangement that these historicist projects have
        produced is a consequence of a utopian search for sources of authenticity
        outside the power structures imposed by \u201Coccupation regimes.\u201D So
        far, this retrospective quest for a safe place \u201Cin- between\u201D has
        resulted in a series of dead ends. Instead of bringing the nation together,
        it has polarized the society. Instead of providing an attractive alternative
        to the moral duplicity of state socialism, it has offered a historical justification
        for ethical relativism. These deadlocks and false turns of postcolonial studies
        of socialism can be seen as reflecting the early stage of this intellectual
        movement. Alternatively, they may signify the emergence of a different\u2014conservative
        and nostalgic\u2014form of postcoloniality. In either case, these debates
        helpfully outline the uneasy process of the retroactive creation of colonial
        subjectivity, demonstrating how the act of reclaiming an important historical
        place can become indistinguishable from being beholden to this place.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>https://commons.mla.org/deposits/item/mla:583</identifier><datestamp>2016-02-29T13:11:39Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc

        Writing\u201D is crafted to help students learn to write and think critically.
        In an effort to hone our critical minds and strengthen our writing, we will
        focus on the learned skills of summarizing, paraphrasing, quoting, evaluating,
        analyzing, and synthesizing. In addition to several short essays, you will
        also be writing a multi-source paper of greater length \u2013 the Research
        Paper. Anything can be bought; but can anyone be bought? Are you selling?
        Or are you selling out? How do we live in the world today? Can we escape capitalism?
        Would we want to? While art is born out of the market, the two are nevertheless
        both at odds and in opposition to one another. In fact, success in the market
        is often understood to mean a decrease in artistic \u201Cvalue.\u201D Conversely,
        a product high in \u201Cartistic\u201D quality is frequently accepted as less
        profitable. \u201CSelling out\u201D is a phrase used to describe the act of
        compromising one\u2019s self with the expectation of some sort of gain. Think
        of all those bands you know that \u201Csell out.\u201D An important part of
        this equation is desire. Why do you want what you want? What makes something
        desirable? Have you ever \u201Csold out\u201D for love? For work? How then
        do we reconcile these seemingly conflicting forces \u2013 art, capitalism,
        and love? Engaging with texts that challenge why we make art, why we love,
        and, at the same time, call these very notions into question, we will read
        novels, films, and songs as we explore the convergence of art, love, and money.
        This is a student-centered course. You must participate to learn. I emphasize
        participation, including listening, thinking, lecture, Vining, group discussion,
        Instagraming, small group discussion, reflection, reading, writing, Tweeting,
        and work-shopping.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>https://commons.mla.org/deposits/item/mla:593</identifier><datestamp>2016-03-03T03:24:28Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc

        do we come from? Our families play an instrumental role in our development.
        Indeed, the idea of the individual, apart from the family, challenges notions
        of family as a continual process, as something permanent. How old is the idea
        that the individual can strike out on her own, separate from her family, and
        thus do as she pleases? Families teach children how to be in the world, and
        particularly, how to be in that world immediately surrounding them; these
        teachings make up culture. Groups of families comprise communities, cities,
        and then nation. So at what point does the larger culture of community, or
        nation, come into conflict with the family? Similarly, when does (Western)
        culture begin to move away from the family model as center? To what extent
        has individualism always already been there? In what manner do we see culture
        clash with, or even in, society? We\u2019ll begin with classical Greek drama,
        and Euripides\u2019 The Bacchae. Euripides sets his play about the Greek god
        Bacchus among family. Part of being mortal is thus manifest as being part
        of family, wherein authority and family are at odds. Shakespeare, some 1,400
        years later, uses pastoral comedy as a means to explore the family in opposition
        to authority. John Milton, in that same early modern period, returns the genre
        of poetry to the classics, with his revision of the Biblical origin of humanity
        as sinning souls. We\u2019ll explore a wide selection of English, American,
        and Hawaiian poets to bridge the gap between the long eighteenth century and
        the present. Continuing our study of the family on stage, we will read Edward
        Albee\u2019s The American Dream and Alani Apio\u2019s Kamau. We\u2019ll also
        be wrapping up the semester with a smattering of Modern and Post-Modern poets,
        from both the Western and Hawaiian traditions.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>https://commons.mla.org/deposits/item/mla:595</identifier><datestamp>2016-03-03T04:13:10Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc

        be me for a while, and I\u2019ll be you.\u201D -The Replacements Introduction
        to Expository Writing is designed to provide instruction and practice in writing,
        editing, and revising short narrative and expository essays. It will also
        provide instruction in organizing your material and in Standard Edited American
        English. The purpose of this course is to develop the critical reading, writing,
        and research skills essential for post-secondary academic scholarship. In
        this particular section of English 101, we will read a number of essays organized
        around a series of topics that are central to our being in the world today.
        As the epigraph from The Replacements suggests, this course is centered on
        the notion of subjectivity. The framing of this subject is also expository
        writing, which means we will be exploring how we think and write about what
        we know. We will begin the semester with life at death, or the dying self.
        These brief essays will lead us into birth and ways of living, or being; followed
        by words on living with the knowledge of death; and the body - sexed, raced,
        and gendered. We end with the choice of life, and what that might mean, and
        we will grapple with these questions across both a short novel and film: Witi
        Ihimaera\u2019s The Whale Rider (1987), and Niko Cara\u2019s adaptation, Whale
        Rider (2002). You will be expected to critically engage with the ideas presented
        in these readings as you participate in class discussions, as you think through
        and write through the material, and as you write your formal essays. My hope
        is that this course will prepare you for your academic future, as well as
        assist you in becoming a critically engaged and informed citizen, committed
        to living and being in a more just and peaceful world.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>https://commons.mla.org/deposits/item/mla:597</identifier><datestamp>2016-03-03T04:19:10Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc

        plague rid you For learning me your language!\u201D (The Tempest, I.ii.362-4).
        What does a home mean to you? Have you left it? How did you get there? Would
        you go back? Starting with the foundational travel narrative in Western literature,
        Homer\u2019s The Odyssey, we\u2019ll journey across time and the page through
        texts invested in home and the journey (there and back). We\u2019ll also be
        asking why we write, or what it means to write. Shakespeare will take us from
        the Classics into the English Renaissance. In The Tempest we have the opportunity
        to explore drama for the stage that is both about the estranged home and the
        process of writing, or crafting art. Leaping ahead into American literature,
        we will read Frederick Douglass\u2019 Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass,
        as an example of the memoir and the power of the written word. Douglass asks
        where his home should be, as well as how he might get there. The memoir will
        lead us into the novel, and Lois-Ann Yamanaka\u2019s Wild Meat and the Bully
        Burgers. Yamanaka offers up a novel about growing up and finding oneself,
        part of which involves finding oneself at home. We launch into the short story
        close to home, with Kristiana Kahakauwila\u2019s This Is Paradise: Stories,
        a collection that asks all sorts of questions about home, the possibility
        of departure and return, as well as identity and knowing. Part of what is
        at stake in this class is a sampling of genre, kind, or type, and the way
        by which writers opt to craft narrative. We start with epic poetry, delve
        into the early modern stage, slip into memoir and rhetoric, wrestle with the
        novel, and close with the short story. This is a student-centered course.
        You must participate to learn. I emphasize participation, including listening,
        lecture, group discussion, small group discussion, and workshopping.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>https://commons.mla.org/deposits/item/mla:599</identifier><datestamp>2016-03-03T04:30:55Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc

        Simon Prosser, Publishing Director, Hamish Hamilton Expository Writing is
        crafted to help students learn to write and think critically. In an effort
        to hone our critical minds and strengthen our writing, we will focus on the
        learned skills of summarizing, paraphrasing, quoting, evaluating, analyzing,
        synthesizing, and creative writing. In addition to several short essays and
        poems, you will also be writing a multi-source paper of greater length. In
        today\u2019s fast-paced world, what do we read? Why do we read? The novel
        has long been the prized literary form, but as Simon Prosser suggests, perhaps
        we have outgrown the novel. Is the short story a better literary form in the
        twenty-first century? Why? And how so? Using contemporary American short stories
        as our primary texts, we will explore writing, the family and love. We will
        start with Rebecca Makkai\u2019s \u201CPainted Ocean, Painted Ship,\u201D
        a story about writing, reading, teaching, nationality, culture, and love.
        Kevin Moffett\u2019s \u201CFurther Reinterpretations of Real-Life Events\u201D
        brings together writing and the family, or, more specifically, fathers and
        sons. At the center of telling stories is the family, as we will see in fiction
        by Charles Baxter and Marlin Barton. Two tales set in Africa, Jennifer Egan\u2019s
        \u201CSafari\u201D and Tea Obreht\u2019s \u201CThe Laugh,\u201D raise questions
        about what it means to know and how families provide us safety. Lori Ostland\u2019s
        \u201CAll Boy\u201D shifts our focus from the family to gender and sexuality,
        leading into the second half of the semester and the theme of love. What is
        love? Brendan Matthews, Wayne Harrison, and Maggie Shipstead provide some
        answers, as well as lead us on to \u201CFree Radicals\u201D by Alice Munro
        and Kristiana Kahakauwila\u2019s \u201CPortrait of a Good Father.\u201D These
        last two show us the lengths people will go (or not go) for love. In closing,
        our texts ask not only what we might do for love, but also who we are.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>https://commons.mla.org/deposits/item/mla:603</identifier><datestamp>2016-03-03T06:43:38Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc

        used to share with my classes that ebooks are outselling books, and like the
        music industry, the book market is now digital. While the record business
        has shifted in profound ways with the rise of digital technology, the book
        press is still in flux. Digital book sales over the past couple of years have
        been fluctuating around book sales. As a professor of English literature,
        how do I take this digital experience into account? What sort of changes have
        I made in my pedagogy to better serve my (digital) students? The online presence
        has been continuously growing since roughly the turn of the century. The Online
        Learning Consortium just published a report on online learning for 2015, from
        which we can the pervasiveness of the online classroom: \u201CMore than one
        in four students (28%0 now take at least one distance education course (a
        total of 5,828,826 students, a year-to-year increase of 217,275)\u201D (Online
        Report Card). Here at Chaminade, many of us are teaching both in brick and
        mortar classrooms and online as overloads. Online, I am not trying to replicate
        what I do in my brick and mortar classes. The brick and mortar experience
        translates badly, and the online experience is always already different. Nonetheless,
        I want to try and get at how we might improve our teaching, in both spaces,
        by strengthening the ways by which we employ Appropriate, Relevant, and Meaningful
        technology. My intention is thus to move critical thinking, writing, editing,
        and representation out into the digital realm. Across three different English
        classes, I encourage the use of critical thinking in my students\u2019 web
        life. Because students are already out there, my work with the widely known
        and used apps Instagram, Twitter, and Vine creates a space for the web to
        be more than mere entertainment. Here then, using the three sites to illustrate,
        are some examples.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>https://commons.mla.org/deposits/item/mla:605</identifier><datestamp>2016-03-07T03:17:05Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc

        are abstract thoughts in one\u2019s mind that can be revealed. Thoughts that
        are suppressed can be revealed in the subconscious mind. Sigmund Freud views
        dreams as one views sleep; as an abstract code that can be decoded through
        actions and through the \u2018slip of the tongue.\u2019 The Freudian slip
        is found in several passages of A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man. When
        using Freud\u2019s technique, a revelation occurs, suggesting that James Joyce
        had, indeed, a stabled long profession as a priest, but not in a traditional
        sense. He used his modernist art form of writing to display religious teachings
        in his books. His religious nature evolved from studying St. Thomas Aquinas
        philosophy on the esthetics. Joyce could not separate religion and writing
        and made being a non-traditional priest an occupation; eliminating the regular
        ordination process, the title, and duties of a traditional priest. In A Portrait,
        Joyce was simply writing a fictional autobiography about his experience in
        school, but his subconscious reveals that in the beginning of the novel, he
        had a deep devotion for both art and priesthood, and in the middle and end
        of the novel reveals several tests he had to partake. As the text deconstructs
        itself, it reveals an adolescent trying to learn how to serve God as a priest
        through the art form of writing.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>https://commons.mla.org/deposits/item/mla:607</identifier><datestamp>2016-03-08T01:47:46Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc

        do we offer feedback to essays? Over time, the response as narrative has become
        problematic. Class sizes have increased, more classes are being taught, fewer
        professors are teaching composition. Time has become even more scarce as duties
        outside the classroom multiply for full-time faculty. In addition, technology
        has changed the way by which papers are written. How then do faculty respond
        to student writing in the twenty-first century? Traditionally, faculty have
        responded to writing in narrative. I am proposing a more effective way to
        respond can be found in rubrics. Analytic rubrics provide students with more
        focused descriptors of student writing. Descriptors are the short narrative
        accounts that correspond to criteria and their corresponding levels. I offer
        four levels across the top of the rubric: emerging, developing, competent,
        and mastery. For purposes of a letter grade, these levels can be easily transposed
        to D, C, B, and A. Criteria, sometimes called dimensions, are provided in
        the column on the left, are variable, and can be modified for each prompt.
        Generally speaking, I am looking at five criteria: tone or voice, content,
        grammar and mechanics, textual evidence, and format. As a means to begin this
        shift in assessment, I offer several prompts and rubrics, to be followed by
        examples of graded student artifacts.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>https://commons.mla.org/deposits/item/mla:611</identifier><datestamp>2016-03-08T06:54:45Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc

        of the literary is populated with an impressive assortment of mad characters

        the suicidal, the abandoned or the simply alienated. Literature inhabits and

        of psychoanalytic critics who repeatedly turned to it. We seek to deconstruct
        this particular binary view of literature-as-madness, psychoanalysis-as-saneness
        by showing how a critic\u2019s preoccupation with the pathology of an author
        can sometimes expose his/her own unconscious complexes, desires or fears.

        House by Charles Dickens is based in the Victorian era and the author writes
        this book with his own experimentation of phenomenology, even though Edmund
        Husserl set the blueprint on the philosophy of phenomenology. According to
        Robert Paradowski, \u201CEvery mental act must have a content, according to
        Husserl, because one cannot be aware without being aware of something; Husserl
        asserted that all acts of consciousness are intentional, that is, that they
        all have an object. Husserl\u2019s study of intentionality led him to the
        crucial belief that reality was neither material nor mental, but experiential.
        This meant that phenomenology was more a method of philosophizing than an
        actual philosophy\u201D (Robert Paradowski). Each passage in Bleak House represents
        the notion of a phenomenon through the characters\u2019 urge to release suppressive
        thoughts in order to be faithfully in-tune to what exist and does not physically
        change. They are consciously exploring the existence of things with their
        minds while being physically in-active. Dickens opposes the Cartesian, Hobbesian,
        and Lockean philosophy by challenging their limited viewpoint through his
        characters, and these fictional beings becomes the examples of opposing the
        rejection against the mind being in public use.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>https://commons.mla.org/deposits/item/mla:621</identifier><datestamp>2016-03-15T19:30:27Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc

        literature</dc:subject><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.17613/M6TW29</dc:identifier><dc:description>Montesquieu's
        ideas on China have been the subject of much study and controversy. The purpose
        of this paper is to suggest that, as discussed in twenty-two books of the
        Esprit des lois, China serves to illustrate Montesquieu's fundamental principles
        and to elucidate his method. References to the empire appear frequently in
        the concluding chapters of books or at the end of sequences of arguments to
        show how relations between various factors can be reversed by special circumstances.
        China is an exception and a paradox. Montesquieu's insistence on the fact
        that the Chinese Empire is a despotic regime aims to convey that his definitions
        of types of government are theoretical and that in reality they encompass
        a variety of forms determined by particular circumstances. China also plays
        an important role in the development of Montesquieu's theory of climate demonstrating
        how the relations between physical and moral causes can be reversed. Wise
        Chinese policies, such as the creation of feudatory states and constructive
        treatment of conquered nations, are described as the counterpart of destructive
        practices. The analysis of the interaction between the distinct elements of
        the esprit g\xE9n\xE9ral is offset and cofirmed by their exceptional fusion
        in Chinese rites. Chinese overpopulation and birth control are the turning
        point in the book on propagation.The importance of China for the opening of
        trade routes to Asia is recognized in the context of the history of commerce.
        The discussion of the expansion of European foreign trade concludes with a
        comparison to the vast extent of Chinese internal trade. In the penultimate
        chapter of the book on the composition of laws China is invoked once again
        to confront theory with experience and legislative uniformity with diversity.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><resumptionToken>oai_dc.f(2016-05-25T00:00:00Z).u(2016-05-27T00:00:00Z):275</resumptionToken></ListRecords></OAI-PMH>"}

        the notion of American identity in the contemporary global era. Lahiri\u2019s
        novel offers us a striking account of transnational identity in which South
        Asian immigrants and their American-born children import practices from their
        country of origin, which they adapt in the new environment and, in turn, adopt
        practices from the new environment, which they adapt in innovative ways to
        help them feel more at ease.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>https://commons.mla.org/deposits/item/mla:635</identifier><datestamp>2016-03-30T18:52:30Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc

        paper offers a brief consideration of the literary ballad as a register of
        what by the mid-\u201960s economists had diagnosed as \u201Curban crisis\u201D
        and in 1970 John Ashbery called \u201Curban chaos.\u201D  I\u2019m particularly
        interested in how poets used the ballad to see and see into the failures of
        the \u201Cspatio-temporal fix\u201D of urban renewal.  My general idea is
        that in the twentieth-century, as the formal properties and \u201Cbarriers\u201D
        \ of traditional ballads fragment and disperse, the non-modern attributes
        of the ballad\u2014its orality, its structure of address, the performative,
        anonymous, narrative dimensions of popular song\u2014appear embossed, lending
        the postmodern ballad\u2019s distortions a specifically comparative and institutional
        character. The ballad\u2019s historical transformation in the crucible of
        \u201Cprint-capitalism\u201D heightens this embossment. By the somewhat incongruous
        term postmodern ballad, I mean to signal the transition from the modern to
        the postmodern that Frederic Jameson has described in terms of a \u201Ctemporal
        sinking to a subordinate feature of space as such\u201D and the shrinkage
        of time to the present.  I see the postmodern ballad\u2019s distinctive responsiveness
        to crises of capital not only as embossment or register, but in the words
        of Gwendolyn Brooks, as a reckoning with \u201Cthe not-old and with surprise\u201D\u2014a
        phrase that seems particularly apt to the lived experience of these crises.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>https://commons.mla.org/deposits/item/mla:637</identifier><datestamp>2016-04-02T14:55:09Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc

        changes that have been witnessed by media in the Arab world have redefined
        media's initial role as a source of information. With the advent of satellite
        television new realities, namely the dismantling of communication boundaries,
        have emerged. At first, such advancements posed a challenge to government
        bodies, specifically in the Arab region; however, the issue has been resolved
        in what has eventually resulted in government-controlled media, independently
        owned broadcasting stations with ties to ruling bodies, and the mushrooming
        of little private ventures owned by businesses or religious/sectarian groups,
        transmitting globally. Not only did this not translate into political or social
        freedoms in the Arab world, but it also failed to challenge pre-existing notions
        of gender. The current media have inadvertently consolidated traditional stereotypes
        of the female in spite of their claim to be a liberating force. In this essay
        I propose to argue that a detailed study of female representation on Arab
        television would reveal an immature and regressive medium, solely interested
        in commodifying and in enfeebling the Arab female. Moreover, an interpretive
        discourse with postcolonial theory and an analysis of what constitutes the
        Arab identity will reveal why such female representations persist.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>https://commons.mla.org/deposits/item/mla:639</identifier><datestamp>2016-04-02T15:07:39Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc

        Plato's Utopia or ideal city is the non-place that holds the promise of perfection,
        it remains the place in which citizens are categorized by a rigid structure.
        Jos\xE9 Saramago, on the other hand, introduces us to a dystopia in his novel
        Blindness, in which one event leads to the ruin of a city. Yet, as with Plato's
        Utopia, a similar desirable separation by the higher authorities is enacted.
        When a strange ailment leads to the blindness of some of the citizens, we
        begin to witness the disintegration of both the human and the city. In The
        Cave, which reverberates with Plato's \u201CSimile of the Cave,\u201D Saramago
        provides an unrelenting criticism of a city's landscape that is changed by
        a blind capitalist system. In this unnamed city, imitation is more valued
        than the real. In the simile, Plato questions what would become of the dwellers
        of the cave if one were to see beyond the screen. In Saramago's novel, the
        lone potter is the one who is able to see beyond the shadows.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>https://commons.mla.org/deposits/item/mla:641</identifier><datestamp>2016-04-02T15:18:08Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc

        switching is a practice exercised by multilingual speakers. Linguists define
        the term as the simultaneous use of more than one language. Code switching
        is prevalent in postcolonial countries in which the colonial language has
        continued to exist alongside the native language. In the past, code switching
        in the Arab world has been confined to those educated in the missionary schools
        set up by the colonial powers. However, with the changes of media, its domain
        has grown to include a larger number of people. The linguistic-anthropologist
        Edward Sapir's hypothesis of linguistic relativity has stressed the important
        role that language has played in the formation of the individual. I partly
        look at the role of the Arab media and its effect on identity formation drawing

        her treatise on abjection, Julia Kristeva argues that the abject is located
        outside the self, remaining in a state of repulsion that threatens to destroy
        the self. Abject representations are prevalent in the way terrorists have
        been portrayed in the Western news media post-September 11, 2001. These images
        of abjection are problematic, as they consolidate the images we have seen
        in Hollywood films representing Arabs. Furthermore, these depictions have
        eroded the fine line between the real and the unreal. This article examines
        the point at which these issues intersect, by analysing individual images
        vis-\xE0-vis film portrayals of the Arab and, ultimately, how the framed images
        of terrorists aired on TV screens have conformed to previously accepted notions
        of the Arab.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>https://commons.mla.org/deposits/item/mla:645</identifier><datestamp>2016-04-02T15:57:32Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc

        his earlier novels, J.M. Coetzee\u2019s The Master of Petersburg, has not
        received the attention that it deserves from the critics.  The novel, which
        is set in Russia not only draws on real aspects of Fyodor Dostoevsky\u2019s
        life but also on certain events in the Russian author\u2019s novels, specifically
        The Devils.  Coetzee\u2019s Dostoevsky is an aging author who is irked by
        the failure of his mental and physical faculties.  His diminishing capabilities
        force him to continuously question the diabolic nature of the writing process.
        \ In this paper, I would like to discuss the tensions that form the basis
        of this novel, namely the old vis-\xE0-vis the young portrayed by the parent
        and child relationship, and the intensifying nature of evil, reflected by
        actions, which invite the demon/muse in, a concept, which began with Stavorgin\u2019s
        confession in The Devils.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>https://commons.mla.org/deposits/item/mla:651</identifier><datestamp>2016-04-02T16:50:04Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc

        Grief, the son enquires of the father as to why he is picking up pebbles,
        to which the father answers that these pebbles may be the petrified pieces
        of his broken heart; the father searches for the pebbles that look like his
        heart and with his fingers try to transform them into the words that can put
        him in touch with his homeland; this exercise he tells his son is to avoid
        getting lost in the loss.  The father is, in fact, resisting the eradication
        of his country that has turned him into an absence, as his story was usurped
        and told by another.  As with the poet Darwish, the father is resisting the
        codification by the other that has turned him into \u2018a refugee\u2019,
        \u2018an absent-presence\u2019, \u2018a stateless person\u2019, and his story
        becomes the story with a hole and will always be the wrong story.  In his
        1964 poem, \u201CBitaqat Hawwiyah,\u201D [Identity Card], the protagonist
        demands that the person inscribe that he is an Arab, in defiance to the non-existence
        that has become to define his being.  On the other hand, in Life and Times
        of Michael K, Michael K is described by the medical officer as a pebble that
        has existed for a long time, unaware and indifferent to its surroundings,
        evading any form of classification, unfortunately in a country whose system
        thrives on categorizing and classifying everyone. The authorities feel they
        have to fill the hole in Michael\u2019s story, but unfortunately their story
        of him becomes the wrong story.  In this paper, I would like to look at Michael
        K\u2019s reluctance to be fixated and pigeon-holed in a category, as others
        try to tell his story, and I would juxtapose this against the cry of the protagonist
        in Darwish\u2019s  \u201CBitaqat Hawwiyah,\u201D  who urges his vanquisher
        to allow him to document his own story, and the protagonist\u2019s desire
        to be heard in both Darwish\u2019s Journal of Ordinary Grief and Absent Present.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>https://commons.mla.org/deposits/item/mla:653</identifier><datestamp>2016-04-02T17:14:39Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc

        his introduction to Mourid Barghouti novel, I saw Ramallah, Edward Said refers
        to the Palestinians as a displaced and a misplaced people.  Regardless of
        the nationalities they carry or countries they live in, they carry with them
        the trauma of events that led to the loss of their homeland, and the grief
        of this loss and endless displacement.  In a conversation between a father
        and a son in Mahmoud Darwish\u2019s Journal of Ordinary Grief, the son enquires
        of the father as to why he is picking up pebbles, to which the father answers
        that these are petrified pieces of his heart; it is a loss he is searching
        for as he refuses to get lost in his loss, which is the loss of his homeland.
        \ The sense of displacement and loss pervade modern Palestinian literature.
        \ In his novel, I was born there, I was born here, Barghouti describes the
        pain as a historical one that refuses to go away.  One way of dealing with
        this pain is to be able to tell one\u2019s story.  But as Barghouti rightly
        remarks, Palestinians are forbidden to tell their stories, as their story
        is often narrated by their enemies, as the conflict over the land becomes
        the struggle to tell the story.  The absence of the story leads to the absence
        of the people, especially when the name Palestine is no longer on the world
        map, and its only mention is in the news as number of casualties or dead.
        \ Palestinians embody this absence and presence. In this paper, I would like
        to look at Barghouti\u2019s I was Born There, I was Born Here, and Deborah
        Rohan\u2019s The Olive Grove: A Palestinian Story as the protagonists revisit
        what is left of the historic Palestine, to make sense of this absence by trying
        to pass on their stories and address the trauma that has marked their lives.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>https://commons.mla.org/deposits/item/mla:655</identifier><datestamp>2016-04-02T17:28:12Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc

        Rushaydaat Street, commonly known as University Street, in the northern Jordanian
        city of Irbid is recognized by the Guinness Book of Records as having the
        world\u2019s largest number of Internet caf\xE9s in one square kilometer.\nBecause
        of the proliferation of computers and Internet service providers, Jordan by
        the 1990s was one of the leading countries in the Arab world in connectivity,
        according to Jihan Buhjat Hadad and Dr. Mohammed S. Shunnaq (2009). Hadad
        and Shunnaq add that the Royal Scientific Association, through its Information
        System\nCenter, helped in spreading the use of computers within Jordanian
        society. Therefore, the government traditionally has encouraged Internet use
        through a conscious effort to make the service available to all Jordanians.
        According to OpenNet (2009), Jordan\u2019s Internet \u201Cremains largely
        unfettered, with filtering applied to a single news Web site that is often
        critical of the Jordanian and other Arab regimes.\u201D However, the OpenNet
        article rightly lists inconsistencies\nin the kingdom\u2019s policies often
        applied to the Internet. The Internet today remains under government control,
        which successive administrations have manipulated to their advantage, sometimes
        providing leniency while at other times withdrawing freedoms when they felt
        a need to curb criticism or dissent. Changes in the 2007\nJordanian press
        law brought online publications \u201Cunder the same law as the written press\u201D
        (CIMA, n.d.). Social media sites in Jordan, on the other hand, have been encouraged;
        the royal family being one of their first users and most ardent supporters.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>https://commons.mla.org/deposits/item/mla:657</identifier><datestamp>2016-04-02T18:06:54Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc

        many occasions cinema has chosen to shoot movies in locales other than the
        ones in which the events of the films are supposed to take place in.  This
        could be due to various reasons, namely cheaper production costs, or inability
        to gain access to the original place.  The choice of location, however, tries
        to provide a mirror image of the original country.  In portrayals of Arab
        lands and namely in Hollywood films, this rarely holds true. Irrespective
        of the country in which the action takes place, the landscapes are the same,
        and the depiction willfully ignores the actual geographical make-up of the
        country at play.  Instead, the Arab countries are always presented as an unidentified
        mass of scorching deserts, and here the emphasis is on the wild, harsh, and
        inhabitable terrain on which sporadic barbarian nomads roam, as only they
        can belong to such landscapes.  Such landscapes can only be tamed by a superior
        force.\nThese immature and uninformed presentations persist to this day in
        film.  Given that the world is becoming more in McLuhan\u2019s term a global
        village, such misrepresentations are not acceptable.  Furthermore, countries
        like the USA, have maintained and especially since September 11th, 2010, that
        they want to erase misunderstandings between the Arab world and the West.
        \ Such representations are reinforcing misconceptions.  One image of the Arab
        city exists.  In this chapter, I choose to analyze the reason behind these
        false portrayals from a postcolonial and postmodern perspectives drawing on
        Albert Memmi, Edward Said, Frantz Fannon and Jean Baudrillard, reflecting
        on films such as The Siege, Syriana, Body of Lies, Disney\u2019s Aladdin on
        the one side and City of Lights and Captain Abu Raed on the other.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>https://commons.mla.org/deposits/item/mla:659</identifier><datestamp>2016-04-02T20:54:15Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc

        1988 and 1994 American comic books engaged the politics, problematics, and
        crises of the AIDS epidemic by injecting the virus and its social, cultural,
        and epidemiological effects on gay men into the four-color fantasies of the
        superhero genre. As the comic-book industry was undergoing major internal
        changes that allowed for more mature, adult storylines, creators challenged
        the Comics Code Authority\u2019s 1954 sanction against the representation
        of homosexuality to create, for the first time, openly gay characters. Creators\u2019
        efforts were driven by a desire to recognize the reality of gay men\u2019s
        lived experiences, especially crucial in the epidemic time of the AIDS crisis.
        Through mainstream superhero comic books a small body of conscientious writers
        and artists confronted stereotypes and misinformation about HIV/AIDS, championed
        gay men\u2019s rights, and fought homophobia. Comic-book creators developed
        a complex, sustained, and lively conversation about HIV/AIDS, gay men, and
        PWAs that was unprecedented both in the history of comic books and of other
        forms of popular culture.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>https://commons.mla.org/deposits/item/mla:665</identifier><datestamp>2016-04-06T17:38:48Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc

        to the interactive affordances of twenty-first century technologies, the relationship
        between readers and texts is often repositioned as part of a communal experience
        of consumption and reproduction. Inclusive in this expanding culture are user-generated
        adaptations of Shakespeare, most saliently fanfic. The fanfic universe prolifically
        crosses genres, putting the Shakespearean urtext in conversation with any
        other object of cultural interest, and occasionally subjugates the Shakespearean
        text to the dominant popular icon of the moment.\nFanfic manifests textual
        enjoyment as a creative act; the genre is both\nrecreational and re-creational,
        resulting in new adaptive works that expand the dramas to include sequels,
        prequels, and off-stage explorations of character and plot. Because Shakespeare
        is experienced variously through printed text, television, film, theatrical,
        or digitized performance \u2013 all of which underline the instability of
        an authoritative Shakespeare text \u2013 Shakespeare studies is uniquely\npositioned
        to expand critical understanding of adaptation and appropriation vis-a-vis
        the fanfiction universe. Fanfic\u2019s online modality, existing on websites
        that facilitate dialogic interaction between author and audience, offers scholars
        an ongoing chronicle of reception. Uniquely, online interactions allow Shakespeare
        cultural critics to analyze the ways user-generated fanfic positions Shakespeare\u2019s\nwork
        as open to transition, crafting adaptations that illustrate what Shakespeare
        means to everyday users.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>https://commons.mla.org/deposits/item/mla:675</identifier><datestamp>2016-04-12T01:25:54Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc

        essay explores the meanings and effects of postcolonial authors\u2019 recent
        refashioning of classical historical fiction. That refashioning has two aims:
        a materialist cartography that counters the nationalist vocation of classical
        historical fiction by revealing the supra-national, global aspirations of
        colonial capitalism as a system; and an effort to retrieve from colonial modernity
        the residues of premodern, often presecular modes of solidarity that persist
        within yet lie \u201Cathwart\u201D the colonial-modern. The analysis focuses
        on novels by Barry Unsworth and Amitav Ghosh. It engages with work on the
        Atlantic and Indian Ocean worlds; with theoretical critiques of utopia; and
        with the Luk\xE1csian concept of typification (and Ian Baucom\u2019s critique
        thereof). The essay concludes by linking the birth of postcolonial historical
        fiction to the form of finance capital undergirding our contemporary moment\u2014a
        form of capital that reprises while intensifying that which held sway at the
        moment of historical fiction\u2019s first emergence.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>https://commons.mla.org/deposits/item/mla:683</identifier><datestamp>2016-04-21T19:46:53Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc

        Darrieussecq's Cl\xE8ves (2011) shocked readers with the vulgarity of its
        language and spurred controversy over its status as a literary text. In this
        article, I show how the novel's \"bad\" language is a foil for Darrieussecq's
        larger project of rewriting the adolescent female body, removing it from the
        sexualized and objectified optic through which it is usually viewed in order
        to stage it instead as a body in process, as a situation. For this body in
        process, gender and sexuality are not givens, but deeply unfamiliar experiences
        that resist the social order\u2019s dominant framing narratives, its scripts
        for normal and normative subjectivation. The novel, through a Wittigian universalization
        of the particular point of view of the female adolescent, gives readers access
        to the experience and the knowledge provided by her body in process.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>https://commons.mla.org/deposits/item/mla:699</identifier><datestamp>2016-05-08T19:25:38Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc

        Woolf\u2019s well known distaste for the generic and aesthetic instability
        of Radclyffe Hall\u2019s novel The Well of Loneliness (1928) finds echoes
        in more recent responses, even as the novel remains an anchor of a lesbian
        literary canon. I demonstrate that Hall\u2019s novel does indeed exhibit generic
        and psychological instability, as a Victorian novel written in the Modernist
        period and as a text that draws its model of identity from sexology within
        a cultural context of Freudian ideas. I argue, however, that this instability
        is not an aesthetic weakness or a sign of retrogression. Rather, I emphasize
        the novel\u2019s intertextual construction and show that Hall addresses both
        the difficulty and the necessity of producing narratives of identity. In rooting
        identity in narrative, she is part of novelistic and psychological traditions
        stretching from Victorian through Modernist literature and beyond.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>https://commons.mla.org/deposits/item/mla:707</identifier><datestamp>2016-05-17T00:07:11Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc

        Baudrillard sees in today\u2019s simulation the model \u2018of a real but
        without origin or reality: a hyperreal\u2019. With the hyperreal, the individual
        is unable to distinguish what is real and what is not. In this article, I
        argue how the pervasiveness of media, in the form of mobile phones, tablets
        with their applications and social networking sites, singularly or in unison
        create and sustain the existence of the hyperreal. They succeed at once through
        an imagined call for urgency and an implosion of meaning that cannot be contained.
        This type of media is a priori a form of simulation, and has not only erased
        the boundaries that exit between the real and the unreal but has also developed
        as a site accountable for continual deference of the being-in-theworld, forcing
        on the latter a perpetual existence in the hyperreal.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>https://commons.mla.org/deposits/item/mla:713</identifier><datestamp>2016-05-26T18:52:38Z</datestamp></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc

        three political tragedies\u2015Hamlet, Macbeth, and King Lear\u2015have numerously
        been presented or adapted on film. These three plays all involve the recurring
        trope of madness, which, as constructed by Shakespeare, provided a wider canvas
        on which to detail those materials that could not be otherwise expressed:
        sexual desire and expectation, political unrest, and, ultimately, truth, as
        excavated by characters so afflicted. Music has long been associated with
        madness, and was often used as an audible symptom of a victim's disassociation
        from their surroundings and societal rules, as well as their loss of self-control.\n\nIn
        Shakespeare, Madness, and Music: Scoring Insanity in Cinematic Adaptations,
        Kendra Preston Leonard examines the use of music in Hamlet, Macbeth, and King
        Lear. Whether discussing contemporary source materials, such as songs, verses,
        or rhymes specified by Shakespeare in his plays, or music composed specifically
        for a film and original to the director's or composer's interpretations, Leonard
        shows how the changing social and scholarly attitudes towards the plays, their
        characters, and the conditions that fall under the general catch-all of \"madness\"
        have led to a wide range of musical accompaniments, signifiers, and incarnations
        of the afflictions displayed by Shakespeare's characters.\n\nFocusing on the
        most widely distributed and viewed adaptations of these plays for the cinema,
        each chapter presents the musical treatment of individual Shakespearean characters
        afflicted with or feigning madness: Hamlet, Ophelia, Lady Macbeth, King Lear,
        and Edgar. The book offers analysis and interpretation of the music used to
        underscore, belie, or otherwise inform or invoke the characters' states of
        mind, providing a fascinating indication of culture and society, as well as
        the thoughts and ideas of individual directors, composers, and actors. A bibliography,
        index, and appendix listing Shakespeare's film adaptations help complete this
        fascinating volume.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><resumptionToken>oai_dc.f(2016-05-25T00:00:00Z).u(2016-05-27T00:00:00Z):325</resumptionToken></ListRecords></OAI-PMH>"}
