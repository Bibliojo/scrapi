        \ language in the Sh\u014Db\u014Dgenzo constructs philosophically significant\
        \ models of linguistic expression and enlightenment. Challenging the conception\
        \ of enlightenment as exclusively Unitarian and ineffable, he drives the expressive\
        \ potentials of koan language to reveal three distinct dimensions of enlightenment,\
        \ each with its own originative experience, language, and operations. By identifying\
        \ the three-dimensional model of enlightenment that the koan model of linguistic\
        \ expression is used to present in the Sh\u014Db\u014Dgenzo, this dissertation\
        \ explains D\u014Dgen's treatment of the relation between enlightenment and\
        \ language as inseparable processes of mutual development.&#xd;\nThe intrinsically\
        \ expressive nature of enlightenment notwithstanding, the differentiation\
        \ of enlightenment into dimensions is not the result of categorization of\
        \ expressive forms or dialectical interaction of logical categories. By following\
        \ the course of the realization of each dimension from its unique originative\
        \ experience through its \"total exertion\" (g\u016Bjin) in praxis to its\
        \ expression, actualization, and \"falling away\" (datsuraku), this dissertation\
        \ attempts to identify dimensions as discrete domains of enlightenment that\
        \ display definite and describable features, relations, careers, operations,\
        \ and soteriological possibilities.&#xd;\nThe first dimension is the domain\
        \ of the unitary dharma that arises and disports in relations of dependent\
        \ co-origination.&#xd;\nThe second dimension is the domain of consummate (buddha)\
        \ dharmas as multiple units of experience that are temporally and causally\
        \ disengaged (zengo saidan) from each other but still enjoy a mutually dependent\
        \ relation to a Hua-yen type of totality.&#xd;\nThe third dimension is the\
        \ domain of the tracelessness that results from datsuraku, \"falling away.\"\
        \ This is the only dimension in which compassion for another being and upaya\
        \ can arise. &#xd;\nThese domains of enlightenment determine rather than merely\
        \ describe the various ways that praxisclarified experience is expressed.\
        \ Because these domains are not simply discontinuous and optional modes of\
        \ experience, but are interpenetrating structures of experience that are investigated\
        \ in praxis as an orderly continuum called the \"way of impermanence\" (muj\u014D\
        \ no d\u014Dri), they are dimensions of enlightenment.</dc:description>\n\
