        \ To investigate a new intervention package aimed at increasing expressive\
        \ word learning by&#xd;\nschool-age children with autism who have limited\
        \ expressive vocabularies. This pilot investigation was&#xd;\nintended to\
        \ show proof of concept.&#xd;\nMethod: Ten children between the ages of 6-10\
        \ years with educational diagnoses of autism and limited&#xd;\nexpressive\
        \ vocabularies at the outset of the study participated. A multimodal intervention\
        \ composed of&#xd;\nspeech sound practice and AAC was used to teach individualized\
        \ vocabulary words that were selected&#xd;\nbased on initial speech sound\
        \ repertoires and principles of phonotactic probability and neighborhood&#xd;\n\
        density. A multiple-probe design was used to evaluate learning outcomes.&#xd;\n\
        Results: Five children showed gains in spoken- word learning across successive\
        \ word sets (High&#xd;\nResponders). Five children did not meet learning criteria\
        \ (Low Responders). Comparisons of behaviors&#xd;\nmeasured prior to intervention\
        \ indicated that High Responders had relatively higher skills in receptive&#xd;\n\
        language, prelinguistic communication, vocal/verbal imitation, adaptive behavior\
        \ and consonant&#xd;\nproductions.&#xd;\nConclusions: The intervention package\
        \ holds promise for improving spoken word productions for some&#xd;\nchildren\
        \ with autism who have limited expressive vocabularies. Further research is\
        \ needed to better&#xd;\ndescribe who may most benefit from this approach\
        \ as well as investigate generalized benefits to untaught&#xd;\ncontexts and\
        \ targets.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2016-02-08T21:14:17Z</dc:date>\n<dc:date>2016-02-08T21:14:17Z</dc:date>\n\

        <dc:description>The goal of this study was to explore the effects of phonotactic\
        \ probability, word length, word frequency, and neighborhood density on the\
        \ words known by children with cochlear implants (CIs) varying in vocabulary\
        \ outcomes in a retrospective analysis of a subset of data from a longitudinal\
        \ study of hearing loss. Generalized linear mixed modeling was used to examine\
        \ the effects of these word characteristics at three time points: pre-implant,\
        \ post-implant, and longitudinal follow-up. Results showed a robust effect\
        \ of neighborhood density across group and time, whereas the effect of frequency\
        \ varied by time. Significant effects of phonotactic probability or word length\
        \ were not detected. Taken together, these findings suggest that children\
        \ with CIs may be able to use spoken language structure in a manner similar\
        \ to their normal hearing counterparts, despite the differences in the quality\
        \ of the input. The differences in the effects of phonotactic probability\
        \ and word length imply a difficulty in initiating word learning and limited\
        \ working memory ability in children with CIs.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2016-02-08T21:14:04Z</dc:date>\n\

        <dc:description>Word learning consists of at least two neurocognitive processes:\
        \ learning from input during training and memory evolution during gaps between\
        \ training sessions. Fine-grained analysis of word learning by normal adults\
        \ provides evidence that learning from input is swift and stable, whereas\
        \ memory evolution is a point of potential vulnerability on the pathway to\
        \ mastery. Moreover, success during learning from input is linked to positive\
        \ outcomes from memory evolution. These two neurocognitive processes can be\
        \ overlaid on to components of clinical treatment with within-session variables\
        \ (i.e., dose form and dose) potentially linked to learning from input and\
        \ between-session variables (i.e., dose frequency) linked to memory evolution.\
        \ Collecting data at the beginning and end of a treatment session can be used\
        \ to identify the point of vulnerability in word learning for a given client\
        \ and the appropriate treatment component can then be adjusted to improve\
        \ the client\u2019s word learning. Two clinical cases are provided to illustrate\
        \ this approach.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2016-02-08T21:13:53Z</dc:date>\n\

        <dc:description>Previous studies showed that a new word that is similar to\
        \ many known words will be learned better than a new word that is similar\
        \ to few known words (Storkel et al., 2006). In the present study we created\
        \ novel words that were phonological neighbors to lexical hermits\u2014or\
        \ known words that do not have any phonological neighbors\u2014that varied\
        \ in frequency of occurrence. After several exposures, participants learned\
        \ a higher proportion of novel words that were neighbors of high frequency\
        \ known-words than nonwords that were neighbors of low frequency known-words.\
        \ The present results have implications for abstractionist versus exemplar\

        <dc:description>The purpose of this study was to test the effect of manipulating\
        \ verb neighbourhood density in treatment targeting the third person singular\
        \ lexical affix. Using a single-subject experimental design, 6 pre-schoolers\

        \ two conditions: 1) treatment with sparse verbs or 2) treatment with dense\
        \ verbs in 12&#xd;\nsessions. The third person singular lexical affix was\
        \ targeted for 12 sessions of treatment in both conditions. Treatment gain\
        \ and generalization were measured as the dependent variables. Third person\
        \ singular % correct change from pre-treatment to post-treatment was measured\
        \ using sentence production tasks with comparisons across the two treatment\
        \ conditions. Treatment gain and generalization were greater for children\
        \ enrolled in the sparse condition. Preliminary clinical recommendations are\

        <dc:description>A corpus of 5,765 consonant-vowel-consonant (CVC) sequences\
        \ was compiled, and phonotactic probability and neighborhood density based\
        \ on both child and adult corpora were computed. This corpus of CVCs, provided\
        \ as supplementary materials, was analyzed to address the following questions:\
        \ (1) Do computations based on a child corpus differ from those based on an\
        \ adult corpus? (2) Do phonotactic probability and/or neighborhood density\
        \ of real words differ from that of nonwords? (3) Do phonotactic probability\

        \ Results showed significant differences in phonotactic probability and neighborhood\
        \ density for child versus adult corpora, replicating prior findings. The\
        \ impact of this difference on future studies will depend on the level of\

        \ and large differences in phonotactic probability and neighborhood density\
        \ were detected between real words and nonwords, which may present methodological\
        \ challenges for future research. Lastly, CVCs composed of earlier acquired\

        <dc:description>Purpose. Phonotactic probability or neighborhood density have\
        \ predominately been defined using gross distinctions (i.e., low vs. high).\
        \ The current studies examined the influence of finer changes in probability\
        \ (Experiment 1) and density (Experiment 2) on word learning.&#xd;\n&#xd;\n\
        Method. The full range of probability or density was examined by sampling\
        \ five nonwords from each of four quartiles. Three- and 5-year-old children\
        \ received training on nonword-nonobject pairs. Learning was measured in a\
        \ picture-naming task immediately following training and 1-week after training.\
        \ Results were analyzed using multi-level modeling.&#xd;\n&#xd;\nResults.\
        \ A linear spline model best captured nonlinearities in phonotactic probability.\
        \ Specifically word learning improved as probability increased in the lowest\
        \ quartile, worsened as probability increased in the midlow quartile, and\
        \ then remained stable and poor in the two highest quartiles. An ordinary\
        \ linear model sufficiently described neighborhood density. Here, word learning\
        \ improved as density increased across all quartiles.&#xd;\n&#xd;\nConclusion.\
        \ Given these different patterns, phonotactic probability and neighborhood\
        \ density appear to influence different word learning processes. Specifically,\
        \ phonotactic probability may affect recognition that a sound sequence is\
        \ an acceptable word in the language and is a novel word for the child, whereas\
        \ neighborhood density may influence creation of a new representation&#xd;\n\
        in long-term memory.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2016-02-08T21:13:25Z</dc:date>\n\

        <dc:description>Purpose The goal of the current study was to examine the effect\
        \ of homonymy (learning a second meaning for a known word form vs. learning\
        \ a novel meaning and novel word form) and articulation accuracy (IN vs. OUT\
        \ sounds) on word learning by preschool children. An added goal was to determine\
        \ whether word frequency altered the effect of homonymy on word learning.&#xd;\n\
        &#xd;\nMethod Twenty-nine 3- to 4-year-old children were taught homonyms and\
        \ novel words. Stimuli further varied in whether homonymy was present in both\
        \ the adult input and the child's output (as for IN sounds) versus present\
        \ only in the child's output (as for OUT sounds).&#xd;\n&#xd;\nResults For\
        \ IN sounds, children learned homonyms more rapidly than novel words. Moreover,\
        \ the homonym advantage was modulated by word frequency, such that children\
        \ learned a new meaning for a high-frequency word more accurately than they\
        \ learned a new meaning for a low-frequency word. In contrast, for OUT sounds,\
        \ there was no evidence that homonymy influenced learning.&#xd;\n&#xd;\nConclusions\
        \ Homonymy in the adult input facilitates word learning by preschool children,\
        \ whereas homonymy in the child's output alone does not. This effect is captured\
        \ in a usage-based model of phonology and the lexicon.</dc:description>\n\

        <dc:description>It has been hypothesized that known words in the lexicon strengthen\
        \ newly formed representations of novel words, resulting in words with dense\
        \ neighborhoods being learned more quickly than words with sparse neighborhoods.\
        \ Tests of this hypothesis in a connectionist network showed that words with\
        \ dense neighborhoods were learned better than words with sparse neighborhoods\
        \ when the network was exposed to the words all at once (Experiment 1), or\
        \ gradually over time, like human word-learners (Experiment 2). This pattern\
        \ was also observed despite variation in the availability of processing resources\
        \ in the networks (Experiment 3). A learning advantage for words with sparse\
        \ neighborhoods was observed only when the network was initially exposed to\
        \ words with sparse neighborhoods and exposed to dense neighborhoods later\
        \ in training (Experiment 4). The benefits of computational experiments for\
        \ increasing our understanding of language processes and for the treatment\
        \ of language processing disorders are discussed.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2016-02-08T21:12:59Z</dc:date>\n\

        <dc:description>The goal of this study was to examine the influence of part-word\
        \ phonotactic probability/neighborhood density on word learning by preschool\
        \ children with normal vocabularies that varied in size. Ninety-eight children\
        \ (age 2;11 \u2013 6;0) were taught consonant-vowel-consonant (CVC) nonwords\
        \ orthogonally varying in the probability/density of the CV (i.e., body) and\
        \ VC (i.e., rhyme). Learning was measured via picture naming. Children with\
        \ the lowest expressive vocabulary scores showed no effect of either CV or\
        \ VC probability/density, although floor effects could not be ruled out. In\
        \ contrast, children with low or high expressive vocabulary scores demonstrated\
        \ sensitivity to part-word probability/density with the nature of the effect\
        \ varying by group. Children with the highest expressive vocabulary scores\
        \ displayed yet a third pattern of part-word probability/density effects.\
        \ Taken together, word learning by preschool children was influenced by part-word\
        \ probability/density but the nature of this influence appeared to depend\

        <dc:description>The goal of this research was to disentangle effects of phonotactic\
        \ probability, the likelihood of occurrence of a sound sequence, and neighbourhood\
        \ density, the number of phonologically similar words, in lexical acquisition.\
        \ Two-word learning experiments were conducted with 4-year-old children. Experiment\
        \ 1 manipulated phonotactic probability while holding neighbourhood density\
        \ and referent characteristics constant. Experiment 2 manipulated neighbourhood\
        \ density while holding phonotactic probability and referent characteristics\
        \ constant. Learning was tested at two time points (immediate vs. retention)\
        \ in both a naming and referent identification task, although only data from\
        \ the referent identification task were analysed due to poor performance in\
        \ the naming task. Results showed that children were more accurate in learning\
        \ rare sound sequences than common sound sequences and this was consistent\
        \ across time points. In contrast, the effect of neighbourhood density varied\
        \ by time. Children were more accurate in learning sparse sound sequences\
        \ than dense sound sequences at the immediate test point but accuracy for\
        \ dense sound sequences significantly improved by the retention test without\
        \ further training. It was hypothesised that phonotactic probability and neighbourhood\
        \ density influenced different cognitive processes that underlie lexical acquisition.</dc:description>\n\

        <dc:description>Two experiments examined the effects of phonotactic probability\

        \ Nonwords orthogonally varying in probability and density were taught with\
        \ learning and retention measured via picture naming. Experiment 1 used a\
        \ within story probability/across story density exposure context. Experiment\
        \ 2 used an across story probability/within story density exposure context.\
        \ Results showed that probability and density interacted to create optimal\
        \ learning conditions. Specifically, rare/sparse sound sequences appeared\
        \ to facilitate triggering of word learning. In contrast, the optimal convergence\
        \ for lexical configuration and engagement was dependent on exposure context.\
        \ In particular, common sound sequences and dense neighborhoods were optimal\
        \ when density was manipulated across stories, whereas rare sound sequences\
        \ and sparse neighborhoods were optimal when density was manipulated within\

        <dc:description>An on-line calculator was developed (http://www.bncdnet.ku.edu/cml/info_ccc.vi)\
        \ to compute phonotactic probability, the likelihood of occurrence of a sound\
        \ sequence, and neighborhood density, the number of phonologically similar\
        \ words, based on child corpora of American English (Kolson, 1960; Moe, Hopkins,\
        \ &amp; Rush, 1982) and compared to an adult calculator. Phonotactic probability\
        \ and neighborhood density were computed for a set of 380 nouns (Fenson et\
        \ al., 1993) using both the child and adult corpora. Child and adult raw values\
        \ were significantly correlated. However, significant differences were detected.\
        \ Specifically, child phonotactic probability was higher than adult phonotactic\
        \ probability, especially for high probability words; and child neighborhood\
        \ density was lower than adult neighborhood density, especially for high density\
        \ words. These differences were reduced or eliminated when relative measures\
        \ (i.e., z scores) were used. Suggestions are offered regarding which values\
        \ to use in future research.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2016-02-08T21:11:48Z</dc:date>\n\

        <dc:description>Purpose&#xd;\n&#xd;\nThe purpose of this study was to differentiate\
        \ the effect of phonotactic probability from that of neighborhood density\
        \ on a vocabulary probe administered to preschool children with or without\
        \ a phonological delay.&#xd;\n&#xd;\nMethod&#xd;\n&#xd;\nTwenty preschool\
        \ children with functional phonological delays and 34 preschool children with\
        \ typical language development completed a 121 item vocabulary probe in both\
        \ an expressive and receptive response format. Words on the vocabulary probe\
        \ orthogonally varied on phonotactic probability and neighborhood density\
        \ but were matched on age-of-acquisition, word frequency, word length, semantic\
        \ set size, concreteness, familiarity, and imagability.&#xd;\n&#xd;\nResults&#xd;\n\
        &#xd;\nResults showed an interaction between phonotactic probability and neighborhood\
        \ density with variation across groups. Specifically, the optimal conditions\
        \ for typically developing children were rare phonotactic probability with\
        \ sparse neighborhoods and common phonotactic probability with dense neighborhoods.\
        \ In contrast, only rare phonotactic probability with sparse neighborhoods\
        \ was optimal for children with phonological delays.&#xd;\n&#xd;\nConclusions&#xd;\n\
        &#xd;\nRare sound sequences and sparse neighborhoods may facilitate triggering\
        \ of word learning for typically developing children and children with phonological\
        \ delays. In contrast, common sound sequences and dense neighborhoods may\
        \ facilitate configuration and engagement for typically developing children\

        <dc:description>Word learning consists of at least two neurocognitive processes:\
        \ learning from input during training and memory evolution during gaps between\
        \ training sessions. Fine-grained analysis of word learning by normal adults\
        \ provides evidence that learning from input is swift and stable, whereas\
        \ memory evolution is a point of potential vulnerability on the pathway to\
        \ mastery.&#xd;\nMoreover, success during learning from input is linked to\
        \ positive outcomes from memory evolution. These two neurocognitive processes\
        \ can be overlaid on to components of clinical treatment with within-session\
        \ variables (i.e., dose form and dose) potentially linked to learning from\
        \ input and between-session variables (i.e., dose frequency) linked to memory\
        \ evolution. Collecting data at the beginning and end of a treatment session\
        \ can be used to identify the point of vulnerability in word learning for\
        \ a given client and the appropriate treatment component can then be adjusted\
        \ to improve the client\u2019s word learning. Two clinical cases are provided\
        \ to illustrate this approach.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2016-02-08T21:11:14Z</dc:date>\n\

        <dc:description>Purpose&#xd;\n&#xd;\nThe purpose was to determine the number\
        \ of semantic neighbors, namely semantic set size, for 88 nonobjects (Kroll\
        \ &amp; Potter, 1984) and determine how semantic set size related to other\
        \ measures and age.&#xd;\n&#xd;\nMethod&#xd;\n&#xd;\nData were collected from\
        \ 82 adults and 92 preschool children in a discrete association task. The\
        \ nonobjects were presented via computer, and participants reported the first\
        \ word that came to mind that was meaningfully related to the nonobject. Words\
        \ reported by two or more participants were considered semantic neighbors.\
        \ The strength of each neighbor was computed as the proportion of participants\
        \ who reported the neighbor.&#xd;\n&#xd;\nResults&#xd;\n&#xd;\nResults showed\
        \ that semantic set size was not significantly correlated with objectlikeness\
        \ ratings or object decision reaction times from Kroll and Potter (1984).\
        \ However, semantic set size was significantly negatively correlated with\
        \ the strength of the strongest neighbor(s). In terms of age effects, adult\
        \ and child semantic set sizes were significantly positively correlated and\
        \ the majority of numeric differences were on the order of 0\u20133 neighbors.\
        \ Comparison of actual neighbors showed greater discrepancies; however, this\
        \ varied by neighbor strength.&#xd;\n&#xd;\nConclusions&#xd;\n&#xd;\nSemantic\
        \ set size can be determined for nonobjects. Specific guidelines are suggested\
        \ for using these nonobjects in future research.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2016-02-08T21:11:03Z</dc:date>\n\

        <dc:description>Purpose&#xd;\n&#xd;\nThe purpose was to determine whether\
        \ semantic set size, a measure of the number of semantic neighbors, influenced\
        \ word learning, and whether the influence of semantic set size was broad,\
        \ showing effects on multiple measures both during and after learning.&#xd;\n\
        &#xd;\nMethod&#xd;\n&#xd;\nThirty-six preschool children were exposed to 10\
        \ nonobjects, varying in semantic set size, paired with 10 nonwords, controlling\
        \ phonotactic probability and neighborhood density. Nonobject \u2013 nonword\
        \ pairs were presented in a game format. Learning was measured in naming and\
        \ referent identification tasks administered before, during, and one-week\
        \ after training.&#xd;\n&#xd;\nResults&#xd;\n&#xd;\nResults showed no differences\
        \ in naming or identifying the referents of the nonobject \u2013 nonword pairs\
        \ with small versus large semantic set sizes before and during training. However,\
        \ one-week after training, children named and identified the referents of\
        \ nonobject \u2013 nonword pairs with small set sizes more accurately than\
        \ those with large set sizes.&#xd;\n&#xd;\nConclusions&#xd;\n&#xd;\nSimilarity\
        \ to known representations appears to influence word learning, regardless\
        \ of whether the similarity involves lexical or semantic representations.\
        \ However, the direction of the effect of similarity to known representations\
        \ on word learning varies depending on the specific type of representation\
        \ involved. Specifically, lexical similarity speeds learning, whereas semantic\

        <dc:description>Purpose&#xd;\n&#xd;\nThe purpose of this study was to differentiate\
        \ effects of phonotactic probability, the likelihood of occurrence of a sound\
        \ sequence, and neighborhood density, the number of words that sound similar\
        \ to a given word, on adult word learning. A second purpose was to determine\
        \ what aspect of word learning (viz., triggering learning, formation of an\
        \ initial representation, or integration with existing representations) was\
        \ influenced by each variable.&#xd;\n&#xd;\nMethod&#xd;\n&#xd;\nThirty-two\
        \ adults were exposed to 16 nonwords paired with novel objects in a story\
        \ context. The nonwords orthogonally varied in phonotactic probability and\
        \ neighborhood density. Learning was measured following 1, 4, and 7 exposures\
        \ in a picture-naming task. Partially correct (i.e., 2 of 3 phonemes correct)\
        \ and completely correct responses (i.e., 3 of 3 phonemes correct) were analyzed\
        \ together and independently to examine emerging and partial representations\
        \ of new words versus complete and accurate representations of new words.&#xd;\n\
        &#xd;\nResultsAnalysis of partially correct and completely correct responses\
        \ combined showed that adults learned a lower proportion of high-probability\
        \ nonwords than low-probability nonwords (i.e., high-probability disadvantage)\
        \ and learned a higher proportion of high-density nonwords than low-density\
        \ nonwords (i.e., high-density advantage). Separate analysis of partially\
        \ correct responses yielded an effect of phonotactic probability only, whereas\
        \ analysis of completely correct responses yielded an effect of neighborhood\
        \ density only.&#xd;\n&#xd;\nConclusions&#xd;\n&#xd;\nThese findings suggest\
        \ that phonological and lexical processing influence different aspects of\
        \ word learning. In particular, phonotactic probability may aid in triggering\
        \ new learning, whereas neighborhood density may influence the integration\
        \ of new lexical representations with existing representations.</dc:description>\n\

        <dc:description>Recent research suggests that phonotactic probability (the\
        \ likelihood of occurrence of a sound sequence) and neighborhood density (the\
        \ number of words phonologically similar to a given word) influence spoken\
        \ language processing and acquisition across the lifespan in both normal and\
        \ clinical populations. The majority of research in this area has tended to\
        \ focus on controlled laboratory studies rather than naturalistic data such\
        \ as spontaneous speech samples or elicited probes. One difficulty in applying\
        \ current measures of phonotactic probability and neighborhood density to\
        \ more naturalistic samples is the significant correlation between these variables\
        \ and word length. This study examines several alternative transformations\
        \ of phonotactic probability and neighborhood density as a means of reducing\
        \ or eliminating this correlation with word length. Computational analyses\
        \ of the words in a large database and reanalysis of archival data supported\
        \ the use of z scores for the analysis of phonotactic probability as a continuous\
        \ variable and the use of median transformation scores for the analysis of\
        \ phonotactic probability as a dichotomous variable. Neighborhood density\
        \ results were less clear with the conclusion that analysis of neighborhood\
        \ density as a continuous variable warrants further investigation to differentiate\
        \ the utility of z scores in comparison to median transformation scores. Furthermore,\
        \ balanced dichotomous coding of neighborhood density was difficult to achieve,\
        \ suggesting that analysis of neighborhood density as a dichotomous variable\
        \ should be approached with caution. Recommendations for future application\
        \ and analyses are discussed.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2016-02-08T21:10:16Z</dc:date>\n\

        <dc:description>The effects of phonotactic constraints (i.e., the status of\
        \ a sound as correctly or incorrectly articulated) and phonotactic probability\
        \ (i.e., the likelihood of a sound sequence) on lexical acquisition have been\
        \ investigated independently. This study investigated the interactive influence\
        \ of phonotactic constraints and phonotactic probability on lexical acquisition\
        \ in 3 groups of children: children with functional phonological delays (PD),\
        \ phonology-matched, younger, typically developing children (PM), and age-/vocabulary-matched\
        \ typically developing peers (AVM). Sixty-eight children participated in a\
        \ multitrial word-learning task involving nonwords varying in phonotactic\
        \ constraints (IN vs. OUT) and phonotactic probability (common vs. rare).\
        \ Correct and error responses were analyzed. Results indicated that OUT sound\
        \ sequences were learned more rapidly than IN sound sequences. This suggests\
        \ that OUT sounds may be salient because they represent only a small subset\
        \ of the child's sound system. The effect of phonotactic probability varied\
        \ across groups: Children with PD showed a common sound sequence disadvantage,\
        \ younger PM children showed a common sound sequence advantage, and AVM children\
        \ showed no effect. Moreover, error analyses indicated that children with\
        \ PD had particular difficulty creating lexical representations and associations\
        \ between lexical and semantic representations when learning common sound\
        \ sequences. Children with PD may rely more heavily on lexical representations\
        \ to learn new words or may have difficulty learning common sound sequences\
        \ because of the high degree of similarity between these sequences and other\
        \ known words. Finally, the effect of phonotactic probability was consistent\
        \ across IN and OUT sound sequences, suggesting that the lexical representation\
        \ of both correctly articulated and misarticulated words is based on the adult-target\
        \ pronunciation.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2016-02-08T21:10:02Z</dc:date>\n\

        <dc:description>Though the influences of syntactic and semantic regularity\
        \ on novel word learning are well documented, considerably less is known about\
        \ the influence of phono-logical regularities on lexical acquisition. The\
        \ influence of phonotactic probability, a measure of the likelihood of occurrence\
        \ of a sound sequence, on novel word learning is investigated in this study.\
        \ Thirty-four typically developing children (from ages 3 years 2 months to\
        \ 6 years 3 months) participated in a multitrial word-learning task involving\
        \ nonwords of varying phonotactic probability (common vs. rare) paired with\
        \ unfamiliar object referents. Form and referent learning were tested following\
        \ increasing numbers of exposures (1 vs. 4 vs. 7) and following a 1-week delay.\
        \ Correct responses were analyzed to determine whether phonotactic probability\
        \ affected rate of word learning, and incorrect responses were analyzed to\
        \ examine whether phonotactic probability affected the formation of semantic\
        \ representations, lexical representations, or the association between semantic\
        \ and lexical representations. Results indicated that common sound sequences\
        \ were learned more rapidly than rare sound sequences across form and referent\
        \ learning. In addition, phonotactic probability appeared to nfluence the\
        \ formation of semantic representations and the association between semantic\
        \ and lexical representations. These results are integrated with previous\
        \ findings and theoretical models of language acquisition.</dc:description>\n\

        <dc:description>Previous studies document an influence of phonological knowledge\
        \ on word learning that differs across development. Specifically, children\
        \ with expressive lexicons of fewer than 50 words learn words composed of\
        \ IN sounds more rapidly than those composed of OUT sounds. In contrast, preschool\
        \ children with larger expressive lexicons show the reverse effect. The goal\
        \ of the current study was to provide a re\u2010analysis of existing data\
        \ to determine if this discrepancy across studies may be related to how phonological\
        \ knowledge has been defined. This study defines knowledge on a continuum\
        \ from most to more to less. Results showed a continuous inverse relationship\
        \ between phonological knowledge and word learning by preschool children.\
        \ Specifically, most phonological knowledge was associated with poorest word\
        \ learning, more knowledge with intermediate word learning, and less knowledge\
        \ with best word learning. Theoretical implications are discussed.</dc:description>\n\

        <dc:description>Standardized vocabulary tests have been criticized for their\
        \ cultural/experiential biases and insensitivity to word learning differences.\
        \ This review discusses the utility of supplementing the diagnostic process\
        \ with a processing-based measure, such as a nonword repetition task. Nonword\
        \ repetition tasks have been heralded as a more sensitive indicator of individual\
        \ differences in vocabulary/word learning. Evidence on the relationship between\
        \ vocabulary and nonword repetition is discussed along with a review of the\
        \ currently available tests of nonword repetition. Suggestions for constructing\
        \ a nonword repetition task specific to the needs of individual clinicians\
        \ are offered.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2016-02-08T20:51:41Z</dc:date>\n\

        <dc:description>Children with early reading and vocabulary deficits often\
        \ struggle in these areas across development. Although direct instruction\
        \ is effective for teaching individual vocabulary words, it is time consuming,\
        \ and may not be sufficient to close the vocabulary gap between good and poor\
        \ readers. Instruction on deriving the meanings of unknown words from context\
        \ may help to increase vocabulary knowledge in children with reading and vocabulary\
        \ deficits. Toward this end, we review the research concerning factors that\
        \ influence word learning from context and instructional approaches that have\
        \ been shown to be effective in teaching derivational skills.</dc:description>\n\

        <dc:description>Crack surveys were performed on nine bridge decks in Virginia.\
        \ Five decks were constructed with a shrinkage reducing admixture (SRA), three\
        \ were constructed with lightweight concrete, and one is used as a control.\
        \ Seven of the decks surveyed are supported by steel girders and two are supported\
        \ by prestressed concrete. Of the seven decks supported by steel girders,\
        \ four contain an SRA, two were constructed with lightweight concrete, and\
        \ one was constructed with conventional concrete and serves as the control.\
        \ One SRA and one lightweight deck were supported by prestressed concrete;\
        \ the SRA deck is supported by a prestressed concrete box beam and the lightweight\
        \ deck is supported by a prestressed concrete slab. The decks were 5 to 31\
        \ months old when the crack surveys were performed. The Virginia bridge decks\
        \ are compared against low-cracking high performance concrete (LC-HPC) and\
        \ conventional Kansas Department of Transportation (KDOT) decks in Kansas.\
        \ The surveys performed in this trip provide a good baseline for future surveys\
        \ and allow for conclusions about the early performance of the bridge decks.\
        \ The decks constructed with an SRA are performing better than the decks built\
        \ with lightweight concrete. Initial surveys suggest that the SRA decks are\
        \ not performing as well as the LC-HPC decks and that the lightweight decks\
        \ are not performing as well as either the LC-HPC or control decks in Kansas.\

        \ Concrete (LC-HPC) bridge decks are summarized and the survey procedure used\
        \ for analysis of cracking performance of bridge decks is described. Thirteen\
        \ LC-HPC decks and thirteen control decks were evaluated using the survey\
        \ procedure. Crack densities were calculated and crack locations marked. LC-HPC\
        \ bridge decks have significantly lower crack densities than do the control\
        \ bridge decks. The majority of cracks develop in the transverse direction,\
        \ directly above and parallel to the reinforcing steel. Longitudinal cracks\
        \ often propagate from the abutments. The results suggest that crack densities\
        \ will increase on the upper portions of superelevated decks due to increased\
        \ settlement cracking caused by the use of high slump concrete and less than\
        \ optimum curing when water is not directly supplied to the superelevated\
        \ side of the deck. Overfinishing of concrete by means of a double-drum roller\
        \ screed may increase cracking by increasing the amount of cement paste at\

        \ the collapse risk of reinforced concrete building columns constructed prior\
        \ to the mid-1970\u2019s, subjected to cyclic lateral loading. These columns\
        \ have reinforcement details deemed inadequate by modern seismic design standards,\
        \ and as such are vulnerable to collapse. Testing of two fullscale, shear-critical\
        \ column specimens was carried out at the NEES-MAST facility at the University\
        \ of Minnesota. The test specimens had nominally identical material and reinforcement\
        \ properties. The primary test variable was the applied axial load, which\
        \ was held constant at 500 kips and 340 kips for the first and second specimens,\
        \ respectively. The specimens were subjected to increasing lateral displacement\
        \ cycles until axial load carrying capacity was lost. The thesis discusses\
        \ the observed lateral and axial load resisting behavior, and analyzes the\
        \ measured responses of the columns up to and beyond the lateral drift at\
        \ which they were able to sustain axial load. Test results indicate that column\
        \ behavior was significantly influenced by the magnitude of the applied axial\
        \ load, and that the ratio of axial load to gross axial capacity of the longitudinal\
        \ reinforcement is a key parameter in identifying columns in which axial failure\
        \ occurs simultaneously with shear failure.</dc:description>\n<dc:date>2016-02-09T20:02:24Z</dc:date>\n\

        \ traffic flow and can create severe safety problems. Due to the rising needs\
        \ in highway maintenance and construction in the United States, the number\
        \ of work zones is increasing nationwide. With a total of 1,010 fatalities\
        \ and more than 40,000 injuries occurring in 2006, improvements in work zone\
        \ safety are necessary. The three&#xd;\nprimary objectives of this research\
        \ project included: 1) to determine the effectiveness of a Portable Changeable\
        \ Message Sign (PCMS) in reducing vehicle speeds on two-lane, rural highway\
        \ work zones; 2) to determine the effectiveness of a Temporary Traffic Sign\
        \ (TTS), (W20-1, \u201CRoad Work Ahead\u201D); and 3) to determine motorists\u2019\
        \ responses to the signage. To accomplish these objectives, field experiments\
        \ were conducted at US-36 and US-73 in Seneca and Hiawatha, Kansas, respectively.\
        \ During the field experiments, an evaluation of the effectiveness of the\
        \ PCMS was conducted under three different conditions: 1) PCMS on; 2)&#xd;\n\
        PCMS off, but still visible; and 3) PCMS removed from the road and out of\
        \ sight. The researchers also divided the vehicles into three classes (passenger\
        \ car, truck, and semitrailer) and compared the mean speed change of these\
        \ classes based on three different sign setups: PCMS on, PCMS off, and the\
        \ use of the TTS (W20-1, \u201CRoad Work Ahead\u201D). A survey was also conducted&#xd;\n\
        at the experimental work zones to obtain a general understanding of the motorists\u2019\
        \ attitudes as they traveled through the construction areas. Based on the\
        \ data analysis results, researchers concluded that the presence of the PCMS\
        \ effectively reduced vehicle speeds on two-lane highway work zones. A slow\
        \ speed is more likely to reduce the probability of a crash or the&#xd;\n\
        severity of a crash. In addition, researchers performed a univariate analysis\
        \ of the variance test to determine if a significant interaction existed between\
        \ motorists\u2019 responses and the sign conditions. The results showed a\
        \ significant interaction between the signs and passenger car vehicles.</dc:description>\n\
