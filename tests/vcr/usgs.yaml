        \ River Basin, Australia\",\"docAbstract\":\"<p><span>Floodplain red gum forests\
        \ (</span><i>Eucalyptus camaldulensis</i><span>&nbsp;plus associated grasses,\
        \ reeds and sedges) are sites of high biodiversity in otherwise arid regions\
        \ of southeastern Australia. They depend on periodic floods from rivers, but\
        \ dams and diversions have reduced flood frequencies and volumes, leading\
        \ to deterioration of trees and associated biota. There is a need to determine\
        \ their water requirements so environmental flows can be administered to maintain\
        \ or restore the forests. Their water requirements include the frequency and\
        \ extent of overbank flooding, which recharges the floodplain soils with water,\
        \ as well as the actual amount of water consumed in evapotranspiration (ET).\
        \ We estimated the flooding requirements and ET for a 38&thinsp;134&thinsp;ha\
        \ area of red gum forest fed by the Murrumbidgee River in Yanga National Park,\
        \ New South Wales. ET was estimated by three methods: sap flux sensors placed\
        \ in individual trees; a remote sensing method based on the Enhanced Vegetation\
        \ Index from MODIS satellite imagery and a water balance method based on differences\
        \ between river flows into and out of the forest. The methods gave comparable\
        \ estimates yet covered different spatial and temporal scales. We estimated\
        \ flood frequency and volume requirements by comparing Normalized Difference\
        \ Vegetation Index values from Landsat images with flood history from 1995\
        \ to 2014, which included both wet periods and dry periods. ET during wet\
        \ years is about 50% of potential ET but is much less in dry years because\
        \ of the trees' ability to control stomatal conductance. Based on our analyses\
        \ plus other studies, red gum trees at this location require environmental\
        \ flows of 2000&thinsp;GL&thinsp;yr</span><sup>&minus;1</sup><span>&nbsp;every\
        \ other year, with peak flows of 20&thinsp;000&thinsp;ML&thinsp;d</span><sup>&minus;1</sup><span>,\
        \ to produce flooding sufficient to keep them in good condition. However,\
        \ only about 120&ndash;200&thinsp;GL&thinsp;yr</span><sup>&minus;1</sup><span>&nbsp;of\
        \ river water is consumed in ET, with the remainder flowing out of the forest\
        \ where it enters the Murray River system.</span></p>\",\"language\":\"English\"\

        :\"<p><span>Permafrost dynamics play an important role in high-latitude peatland\
        \ carbon balance and are key to understanding the future response of soil\

        \ feedback in peatlands through effects on peat properties. We compiled peatland\
        \ plant macrofossil records for the northern permafrost zone (515 cores from\
        \ 280 sites) and classified samples by vegetation type and environmental class\
        \ (fen, bog, tundra and boreal permafrost, and thawed permafrost). We examined\
        \ differences in peat properties (bulk density, carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and\
        \ organic matter content, and C/N ratio) and C accumulation rates among vegetation\
        \ types and environmental classes. Consequences of permafrost aggradation\
        \ differed between boreal and tundra biomes, including differences in vegetation\
        \ composition, C/N ratios, and N content. The vegetation composition of tundra\
        \ permafrost peatlands was similar to permafrost-free fens, while boreal permafrost\
        \ peatlands more closely resembled permafrost-free bogs. Nitrogen content\
        \ in boreal permafrost and thawed permafrost peatlands was significantly lower\
        \ than in permafrost-free bogs despite similar vegetation types (0.9% versus\
        \ 1.5% N). Median long-term C accumulation rates were higher in fens (23&thinsp;g\

        \ Landsat applications have been fostered by a policy change in 2008 that\
        \ made analysis-ready Landsat data free and open access. Since 1972, Landsat\
        \ has been collecting images of the Earth, with the early years of the program\
        \ constrained by onboard satellite and ground systems, as well as limitations\
        \ across the range of required computing, networking, and storage capabilities.\
        \ Rather than robust on-satellite storage for transmission via high bandwidth\
        \ downlink to a centralized storage and distribution facility as with Landsat-8,\
        \ a network of receiving stations, one operated by the U.S. government, the\
        \ other operated by a community of International Cooperators (ICs), were utilized.\
        \ ICs paid a fee for the right to receive and distribute Landsat data and\
        \ over time, more Landsat data was held outside the archive of the United\
        \ State Geological Survey (USGS) than was held inside, much of it unique.\
        \ Recognizing the critical value of these data, the USGS began a Landsat Global\
        \ Archive Consolidation (LGAC) initiative in 2010 to bring these data into\
        \ a single, universally accessible, centralized global archive, housed at\
        \ the Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) Center in Sioux Falls,\
        \ South Dakota. The primary LGAC goals are to inventory the data held by ICs,\
        \ acquire the data, and ingest and apply standard ground station processing\
        \ to generate an L1T analysis-ready product. As of January 1, 2015 there were\
        \ 5,532,454 images in the USGS archive. LGAC has contributed approximately\
        \ 3.2 million of those images, more than doubling the original USGS archive\
        \ holdings. Moreover, an additional 2.3 million images have been identified\
        \ to date through the LGAC initiative and are in the process of being added\
        \ to the archive. The impact of LGAC is significant and, in terms of images\
        \ in the collection, analogous to that of having had&nbsp;</span><i>two</i><span>additional\
        \ Landsat-5 missions. As a result of LGAC, there are regions of the globe\
        \ that now have markedly improved Landsat data coverage, resulting in an enhanced\
        \ capacity for mapping, monitoring change, and capturing historic conditions.\
        \ Although future missions can be planned and implemented, the past cannot\
        \ be revisited, underscoring the value and enhanced significance of historical\
        \ Landsat data and the LGAC initiative. The aim of this paper is to report\
        \ the current status of the global USGS Landsat archive, document the existing\
        \ and anticipated contributions of LGAC to the archive, and characterize the\
        \ current acquisitions of Landsat-7 and Landsat-8. Landsat-8 is adding data\
        \ to the archive at an unprecedented rate as nearly all terrestrial images\
        \ are now collected. We also offer key lessons learned so far from the LGAC\
        \ initiative, plus insights regarding other critical elements of the Landsat\
        \ program looking forward, such as acquisition, continuity, temporal revisit,\
        \ and the importance of continuing to operationalize the Landsat program.</span></p>\"\

        :\"<p><span>Riverine flooding is a significant global issue. Although it is\
        \ well documented that the influence of landscape structure on floods decreases\
        \ as flood size increases, studies that define a threshold flood-return period,\
        \ above which landscape features such as topography, land cover and impoundments\
        \ can curtail floods, are lacking. Further, the relative influences of natural\
        \ versus built features on floods is poorly understood. Assumptions about\
        \ the types of floods that can be managed have considerable implications for\
        \ the cost-effectiveness of decisions to invest in transforming land cover\
        \ (e.g., reforestation) and in constructing structures (e.g., storm-water\
        \ ponds) to control floods. This study defines parameters of floods for which\
        \ changes in landscape structure can have an impact. We compare nine flood-return\
        \ periods across 31 watersheds with widely varying topography and land cover\
        \ in the southeastern United States, using long-term hydrologic records (&ge;20\
        \ years). We also assess the effects of built flow-regulating features (best\
        \ management practices and artificial water bodies) on selected flood metrics\
        \ across urban watersheds. We show that landscape features affect magnitude\
        \ and duration of only those floods with return periods &le;10 years, which\
        \ suggests that larger floods cannot be managed effectively by manipulating\
        \ landscape structure. Overall, urban watersheds exhibited larger (270&nbsp;m</span><sup>3</sup><span>/s)\

        \ is a widely valued and studied service provided by watersheds. Flood regulation\
        \ benefits people directly by decreasing the socio-economic costs of flooding\
        \ and indirectly by its positive impacts on cultural (e.g., fishing) and provisioning\
        \ (e.g., water supply) ecosystem services. Like other regulating ecosystem\
        \ services (e.g., pollination, water purification), flood regulation is often\
        \ enhanced or replaced by technology, but the relative efficacy of natural\
        \ versus technological features in controlling floods has scarcely been examined.\
        \ In an effort to assess flood regulation capacity for selected urban watersheds\
        \ in the southeastern United States, we: (1) used long-term flood records\
        \ to assess relative influence of technological and biophysical indicators\
        \ on flood magnitude and duration, (2) compared the widely used runoff curve\
        \ number (RCN) approach for assessing the biophysical capacity to regulate\
        \ floods to an alternative approach that acknowledges land cover and soil\
        \ properties separately, and (3) mapped technological and biophysical flood\
        \ regulation capacities based on indicator importance-values derived for flood\
        \ magnitude and duration. We found that watersheds with high biophysical (via\
        \ the alternative approach) and technological capacities lengthened the duration\
        \ and lowered the peak of floods. We found the RCN approach yielded results\
        \ opposite that expected, possibly because it confounds soil and land cover\
        \ processes, particularly in urban landscapes, while our alternative approach\
        \ coherently separates these processes. Mapping biophysical (via the alternative\
        \ approach) and technological capacities revealed great differences among\
        \ watersheds. Our study improves on previous mapping of flood regulation by\
        \ (1) incorporating technological capacity, (2) providing high spatial resolution\
        \ (i.e., 10-m pixel) maps of watershed capacities, and (3) deriving importance-values\
        \ for selected landscape indicators. By accounting for technology that enhances\
        \ or replaces natural flood regulation, our approach enables watershed managers\
        \ to make more informed choices in their flood-control investments.</span></p>\"\

        :\"<p><span>Floodplain surface topography is an important component of floodplain\
        \ ecosystems. It is the primary physical template upon which ecosystem processes\
        \ are acted out, and complexity in this template can contribute to the high\
        \ biodiversity and productivity of floodplain ecosystems. There has been a\
        \ limited appreciation of floodplain surface complexity because of the traditional\
        \ focus on temporal variability in floodplains as well as limitations to quantifying\
        \ spatial complexity. An index of floodplain surface complexity (FSC) is developed\
        \ in this paper and applied to eight floodplains from different geographic\
        \ settings. The index is based on two key indicators of complexity, variability\
        \ in surface geometry (VSG) and the spatial organisation of surface conditions\
        \ (SPO), and was determined at three sampling scales. FSC, VSG, and SPO varied\
        \ between the eight floodplains and these differences depended upon sampling\
        \ scale. Relationships between these measures of spatial complexity and seven\
        \ geomorphological and hydrological drivers were investigated. There was a\
        \ significant decline in all complexity measures with increasing floodplain\
        \ width, which was explained by either a power, logarithmic, or exponential\
        \ function. There was an initial rapid decline in surface complexity as floodplain\
        \ width increased from 1.5 to 5 km, followed by little change in floodplains\
        \ wider than 10 km. VSG also increased significantly with increasing sediment\
        \ yield. No significant relationships were determined between any of the four\

        :\"<p>Bioretention gardens are used to help mitigate stormwater runoff in\
        \ urban settings in an attempt to restore the hydrologic response of the developed\
        \ land to a natural predevelopment response in which more water is infiltrated\
        \ rather than routed directly to urban drainage networks. To better understand\
        \ the performance of bioretention gardens in facilitating infiltration of\
        \ stormwater in eastern Nebraska, the U.S. Geological Survey, in cooperation\
        \ with the Douglas County Environmental Services and the Nebraska Environmental\
        \ Trust, assessed the water balance of two bioretention gardens located in\
        \ Omaha, Nebraska by monitoring the amount of stormwater entering and leaving\
        \ the gardens. One garden is on the Douglas County Health Center campus, and\
        \ the other garden is on the property of the Eastern Nebraska Office on Aging.</p><p>For\
        \ the Douglas County Health Center, bioretention garden performance was evaluated\
        \ on the basis of volume reduction by comparing total inflow volume to total\
        \ outflow volume. The bioretention garden reduced inflow volumes from a minimum\
        \ of 33 percent to 100 percent (a complete reduction in inflow volume) depending\
        \ on the size of the event. Although variable, the percent reduction of the\
        \ inflow volume tended to decrease with increasing total event rainfall. To\
        \ assess how well the garden reduces stormwater peak inflow rates, peak inflows\
        \ were plotted against peak outflows measured at the bioretention garden.\
        \ Only 39 of the 255 events had any overflow, indicating 100 percent peak\
        \ reduction in the other events. Of those 39 events having overflow, the mean\
        \ peak reduction was 63 percent.</p><p>No overflow events were recorded at\
        \ the bioretention garden at the Eastern Nebraska Office on Aging; therefore,\
        \ data were not available for an event-based overflow analysis.Monitoring\
        \ period summary of the water balance at both bio-retention gardens indicates\
        \ that most of the stormwater in the bioretention gardens is stored in the\
        \ subsurface.</p><p>Evapotranspiration was attributed to a small percentage\
        \ of the outputs on an annual basis (3 percent at Douglas County Health Center\
        \ site and 5 percent at Eastern Nebraska Office onAging site), which indicates\
        \ that vegetative water uptake is not a primary factor in the water budget.</p>\"\

        docAbstract\":\"<p>Surface-water supplies are important sources of drinking\
        \ water for residents in the Triangle area of North Carolina, which is located\
        \ within the upper Cape Fear and Neuse River Basins. Since 1988, the U.S.\
        \ Geological Survey and a consortium of local governments have tracked water-quality\
        \ conditions and trends in several of the area&rsquo;s water-supply lakes\
        \ and streams. This report summarizes data collected through this cooperative\
        \ effort, known as the Triangle Area Water Supply Monitoring Project, during\
        \ October 2009 through September 2010 (water year 2010) and October 2010 through\
        \ September 2011 (water year 2011). Major findings for this data-collection\
        \ effort include</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Annual precipitation was approximately 4\
        \ percent above the long-term mean (average) annual precipitation in 2010\
        \ and approximately 6 percent below the long-term mean in 2011.</li>\\n<li>In\
        \ water year 2010, streamflow was near the long-term mean for most of the\
        \ period for the 10 project streamflow gaging stations. Streamflow was near\
        \ or below the long-term mean at the same streamflow gaging stations during\
        \ the 2011 water year.</li>\\n<li>More than 13,000 individual measurements\
        \ of water quality were made at a total of 28 sites&mdash;17 in the Neuse\
        \ River Basin and 11 in the Cape Fear River Basin. Forty-three water-quality\
        \ properties or constituents were measured; North Carolina water-quality standards\
        \ exist for 21 of these.</li>\\n<li>All observations met State water-quality\
        \ standards for water temperature, hardness, chloride, fluoride, sulfate,\
        \ nitrate plus nitrite, arsenic, cadmium, chromium, lead, nickel, and selenium.</li>\\\
        n<li>State water-quality standards were exceeded one or more times for dissolved\
        \ oxygen, dissolved oxygen percent saturation, pH, copper, iron, manganese,\
        \ mercury, silver, and zinc. Exceedances occurred at 27 sites&mdash;17 in\
        \ the Neuse River Basin and 10 in the Cape Fear River Basin.</li>\\n<li>Stream\
        \ samples collected during storm events contained elevated concentrations\
        \ of 25 water-quality constituents relative to non-storm events.</li>\\n</ul>\"\

        \ neonatal pronghorn\",\"docAbstract\":\"<p><span>Increased understanding\
        \ of the influence of habitat (e.g., composition, patch size) and intrinsic\
        \ (e.g., age, birth mass) factors on survival of neonatal pronghorn (</span><i>Antilocapra\
        \ americana</i><span>) is a prerequisite to successful management programs,\
        \ particularly as they relate to population dynamics and the role of population\
        \ models in adaptive species management. Nevertheless, few studies have presented\
        \ empirical data quantifying the influence of habitat variables on survival\
        \ of neonatal pronghorn. During 2002&ndash;2005, we captured and radiocollared\
        \ 116 neonates across two sites in western South Dakota. We documented 31\
        \ deaths during our study, of which coyote (</span><i>Canis latrans</i><span>)\
        \ predation (</span><i>n</i><span>&nbsp;= 15) was the leading cause of mortality.\
        \ We used known fate analysis in Program MARK to investigate the influence\
        \ of intrinsic and habitat variables on neonatal survival. We generated a\
        \ priori models that we grouped into habitat and intrinsic effects. The highest-ranking\
        \ model indicated that neonate mortality was best explained by site, percent\
        \ grassland, and open water habitat; 90-day survival (0.80; 90% CI = 0.71&ndash;0.88)\
        \ declined 23% when grassland and water increased from 80.1 to 92.3% and 0.36\
        \ to 0.40%, respectively, across 50% natal home ranges. Further, our results\
        \ indicated that grassland patch size and shrub density were important predictors\
        \ of neonate survival; neonate survival declined 17% when shrub density declined\
        \ from 5.0 to 2.5 patches per 100 ha. Excluding the site covariates, intrinsic\
        \ factors (i.e., sex, age, birth mass, year, parturition date) were not important\
        \ predictors of survival of neonatal pronghorns. Further, neonatal survival\
        \ may depend on available land cover and interspersion of habitats. We have\
        \ demonstrated that maintaining minimum and maximum thresholds for habitat\
        \ factors (e.g., percentages of grassland and open water patches, density\
        \ of shrub patches) throughout natal home ranges will in turn, ensure relatively\
        \ high (&gt;0.50) neonatal survival rates, especially as they relate to coyote\
        \ predation. Thus, landscape level variables (particularly percentages of\
        \ open water, grassland habitats, and shrub density) should be incorporated\
        \ into the development or implementation of pronghorn management plans across\
        \ sagebrush steppe communities of the western Dakotas, and potentially elsewhere\
        \ within the geographic range of pronghorn.</span></p>\",\"language\":\"English\"\

        \ is a fundamental characteristic of rivers that can be disrupted by natural\
        \ and anthropogenic processes. Dams are significant disruptions to streams.\
        \ Over 2,000,000 low-head dams (&lt;7.6 m high) fragment United States rivers.\
        \ Despite potential adverse impacts of these ubiquitous disturbances, the\
        \ spatial impacts of low-head dams on geomorphology and ecology are largely\
        \ untested. Progress for research and conservation is impaired by not knowing\
        \ the magnitude of low-head dam impacts. Based on the geomorphic literature,\
        \ we refined a methodology that allowed us to quantify the spatial extent\
        \ of low-head dam impacts (herein dam footprint), assessed variation in dam\
        \ footprints across low-head dams within a river network, and identified select\
        \ aspects of the context of this variation. Wetted width, depth, and substrate\
        \ size distributions upstream and downstream of six low-head dams within the\
        \ Upper Neosho River, Kansas, United States of America were measured. Total\
        \ dam footprints averaged 7.9 km (3.0&ndash;15.3 km) or 287 wetted widths\
        \ (136&ndash;437 wetted widths). Estimates included both upstream (mean: 6.7\
        \ km or 243 wetted widths) and downstream footprints (mean: 1.2 km or 44 wetted\
        \ widths). Altogether the six low-head dams impacted 47.3 km (about 17%) of\
        \ the mainstem in the river network. Despite differences in age, size, location,\
        \ and primary function, the sizes of geomorphic footprints of individual low-head\
        \ dams in the Upper Neosho river network were relatively similar. The number\
        \ of upstream dams and distance to upstream dams, but not dam height, affected\
        \ the spatial extent of dam footprints. In summary, ubiquitous low-head dams\
        \ individually and cumulatively altered lotic ecosystems. Both characteristics\
        \ of individual dams and the context of neighboring dams affected low-head\
        \ dam impacts within the river network. For these reasons, low-head dams require\
        \ a different, more integrative, approach for research and management than\
        \ the individualistic approach that has been applied to larger dams.</span></p>\"\

        :\"<p><span>Ethical treatment of research animals is required under the Animal\
        \ Welfare Act. This includes trapping methodologies that reduce unnecessary\
        \ pain and duress. Traps used in research should optimize animal welfare conditions\
        \ within the context of the proposed research study. Several trapping techniques\
        \ are used in the study of lesser prairie-chickens, despite lack of knowledge\
        \ of trap injury caused by the various methods. From 2006 to 2012, we captured\
        \ 217, 40, and 144 lesser prairie-chickens&nbsp;</span><i>Tympanuchus pallidicinctus</i><span>&nbsp;using\
        \ walk-in funnel traps, rocket nets, and drop nets, respectively, in New Mexico\
        \ and Texas, to assess the effects of capture technique on injury and survival\
        \ of the species. We monitored radiotagged, injured lesser prairie-chickens\
        \ 7&ndash;65 d postcapture to assess survival rates of injured individuals.\
        \ Injuries occurred disproportionately among trap type, injury type, and sex.\
        \ The predominant injuries were superficial cuts to the extremities of males\
        \ captured in walk-in funnel traps. However, we observed no mortalities due\
        \ to trapping, postcapture survival rates of injured birds did not vary across\
        \ trap types, and the daily survival probability of an injured and uninjured\
        \ bird was &ge;99%. Frequency and intensity of injuries in walk-in funnel\
        \ traps are due to the passive nature of these traps (researcher cannot select\
        \ specific individuals for capture) and incidental capture of individuals\
        \ not needed for research. Comparatively, rocket nets and drop nets allow\
        \ observers to target birds for capture and require immediate removal of captured\
        \ individuals from the trap. Based on our results, trap injuries would be\
        \ reduced if researchers monitor and immediately remove birds from walk-in\
        \ funnels before they injure themselves; move traps to target specific birds\
        \ and reduce recaptures; limit the number of consecutive trapping days on\
        \ a lek; and use proper netting techniques that incorporate quick, efficient,\
        \ trained handling procedures.</span></p>\",\"language\":\"English\",\"doi\"\

        ,\"docAbstract\":\"<p><span>Heavy sediment loads in the Sumas River of Whatcom\
        \ County, Washington, increase seasonal turbidity and cause locally acute\
        \ sedimentation. Most sediment in the Sumas River is derived from a deep-seated\
        \ landslide of serpentinite that is located on Sumas Mountain and drained\
        \ by Swift Creek, a tributary to the Sumas River. This mafic sediment contains\
        \ high amounts of naturally occurring asbestiform chrysotile. A known human-health\
        \ hazard, asbestiform chrysotile comprises 0.25\u201337 percent, by mass,\
        \ of the total suspended sediment sampled from the Sumas River as part of\
        \ this study, which included part of water year 2011 and all of water years\
        \ 2012 and 2013. The suspended-sediment load in the Sumas River at South Pass\
        \ Road, 0.6 kilometers (km) downstream of the confluence with Swift Creek,\
        \ was 22,000 tonnes (t) in water year 2012 and 49,000 t in water year 2013.\
        \ The suspended\u2011sediment load at Telegraph Road, 18.8 km downstream of\
        \ the Swift Creek confluence, was 22,000 t in water year 2012 and 27,000 t\
        \ in water year 2013. Although hydrologic conditions during the study were\
        \ wetter than normal overall, the 2-year flood peak was only modestly exceeded\
        \ in water years 2011 and 2013; runoff\u2011driven geomorphic disturbance\
        \ to the watershed, which might have involved mass wasting from the landslide,\
        \ seemed unexceptional. In water year 2012, flood peaks were modest, and the\
        \ annual streamflow was normal. The fact that suspended-sediment loads in\
        \ water year 2012 were equivalent at sites 0.6 and 18.8 km downstream of the\
        \ sediment source indicates that the conservation of suspended\u2011sediment\
        \ load can occur under normal hydrologic conditions. The substantial decrease\
        \ in suspended-sediment load in the downstream direction in water year 2013\
        \ was attributed to either sedimentation in the intervening river reach, transfer\
        \ to bedload as an alternate mode of sediment transport, or both.</span></p><p><span>The\
        \ sediment in the Sumas River is distinct from sediment in most other river\
        \ systems because of the large percentage of asbestiform chrysotile in suspension.\
        \ The suspended sediment carried by the Sumas River consists of three major\
        \ components: (1) a relatively dense, largely non-flocculated material that\
        \ settles rapidly out of suspension; (2) a lighter component containing relatively\
        \ high proportions of flocculated material, much of it composed of asbestiform\
        \ chrysotile; and (3) individual chrysotile fibers that are too small to flocculate\
        \ or settle out, and remain in suspension as wash load (these fibers are on\
        \ the order of microns in length and tenths of microns in diameter). Whereas\
        \ the bulk density of the first (heaviest) component of suspended sediment\
        \ was between 1.5 and 1.6 grams per cubic centimeter (g/cm3), the bulk density\
        \ of the flocculated material was an order of magnitude lower (0.16 g/cm3),\
        \ even after 24 hours of settling. Soon after immersion in water, the fresh\
        \ chrysotile fibers derived from the Swift Creek landslide seem to flocculate\
        \ readily into large bundles, or floccules, that exhibit settling velocities\
        \ characteristic of coarse silts and fine sands (30 and 250 micrometers).\
        \ In quiescent water within this river system, the floccules settle out quickly,\
        \ but still leave between 2.4 and 19.5 million chrysotile fibers per liter\
        \ in the clear overlying water. Consistent with the results from previous\
        \ laboratory research, the amounts of asbestiform chrysotile in the water\
        \ column in Swift Creek, as well as in the Sumas River close to and downstream\
        \ of its confluence with Swift Creek, were determined to be directly correlated\
        \ with pH. This observation offers a possible alternative to either turbidity\
        \ or suspended\u2011sediment concentration as a surrogate for the concentration\
        \ of fresh asbestiform chrysotile in suspension.</span></p><p><span>Continued\
        \ movement and associated erosion of the landslide through mass wasting and\
        \ runoff will maintain large sediment loads in Swift Creek and in the Sumas\
        \ River for the foreseeable future. Given the present channel morphology of\
        \ the river system, aggradation (that is, sediment accumulation) in Swift\
        \ Creek and the Sumas River are also likely to continue.</span></p>\",\"language\"\

        \ is a common activity throughout the world; yet, little is known about the\
        \ extent of feeding gulls in urban areas. We monitored 8 parking lots in central\
        \ Massachusetts, USA, during the fall and winter of 2011 to 2013 in 4 monitoring\
        \ sessions to document the number of gulls present, the frequency of human&ndash;gull\
        \ feeding interactions, and the effectiveness of signage and direct interaction\
        \ in reducing human-provisioned food. Parking lots were divided between &ldquo;education&rdquo;\
        \ and &ldquo;no-education&rdquo; lots. In education lots, we erected signs\
        \ about problems caused when people feed birds and also asked people to stop\
        \ feeding birds. We did not erect signs or ask people to stop feeding birds\
        \ at no-education lots. We spent &gt;1,200 hours in parking lots (range =\
        \ 136 to 200 hours per parking lot), and gulls were counted every 20 minutes.\
        \ We conducted &gt;4,000 counts, and ring-billed gulls (Lorus delawarensis)\
        \ accounted for 98% of all gulls. Our educational efforts were minimally effective.\
        \ There were fewer feedings (P = 0.01) in education lots during one of the\
        \ monitoring sessions but significantly more gulls (P = 0.008) in education\
        \ lots during 2 monitoring sessions. While there was a marginal decrease (P\
        \ = 0.055) in the number of feedings after no-education lots were transformed\
        \ into education lots, there was no difference in gull numbers in these lots\
        \ (P = 0.16). Education appears to have some influence in reducing the number\
        \ of people feeding gulls, but our efforts were not able to reduce the number\
        \ of human feeders or the amount of food enough to influence the number of\
        \ gulls using parking lots.</p>\",\"language\":\"English\",\"publisher\":\"\

        \ petrel&nbsp;</span><i>Pterodroma hasitata</i><span>&nbsp;is an endangered\
        \ seabird with fewer than 2000 breeding pairs restricted to a few breeding\
        \ sites in Haiti and the Dominican Republic. To date, use areas at sea have\
        \ been determined entirely from vessel-based surveys and opportunistic sightings\
        \ and, as such, spatial and temporal gaps in our understanding of the species&rsquo;\
        \ marine range are likely. To enhance our understanding of marine use areas,\
        \ we deployed satellite tags on 3 black-capped petrels breeding on Hispaniola,\
        \ representing the first tracking study for this species and one of the first\
        \ published tracking studies for any breeding seabird in the Caribbean. During\
        \ chick rearing, petrels primarily used marine habitats in the southern Caribbean\
        \ Sea (ca. 18.0&deg; to 11.5&deg;N, 70.0&deg; to 75.5&deg;W) between the breeding\
        \ site and the coasts of Venezuela and Colombia. Maximum distance from the\
        \ breeding sites ranged from ca. 500 to 1500 km during the chick-rearing period.\
        \ During the post-breeding period, each bird dispersed north and used waters\
        \ west of the Gulf Stream offshore of the mid- and southern Atlantic coasts\
        \ of the USA as well as Gulf Stream waters and deeper pelagic waters east\
        \ of the Gulf Stream. Maximum distance from the breeding sites ranged from\
        \ ca. 2000 to 2200 km among birds during the nonbreeding period. Petrels used\
        \ waters located within 14 different exclusive economic zones, suggesting\

        \ (GIWs), those surrounded by uplands, exchange materials, energy, and organisms\
        \ with other elements in hydrological and habitat networks, contributing to\
        \ landscape functions, such as flow generation, nutrient and sediment retention,\
        \ and biodiversity support. GIWs constitute most of the wetlands in many North\
        \ American landscapes, provide a disproportionately large fraction of wetland\
        \ edges where many functions are enhanced, and form complexes with other water\
        \ bodies to create spatial and temporal heterogeneity in the timing, flow\
        \ paths, and magnitude of network connectivity. These attributes signal a\
        \ critical role for GIWs in sustaining a portfolio of landscape functions,\
        \ but legal protections remain weak despite preferential loss from many landscapes.\
        \ GIWs lack persistent surface water connections, but this condition does\
        \ not imply the absence of hydrological, biogeochemical, and biological exchanges\
        \ with nearby and downstream waters. Although hydrological and biogeochemical\
        \ connectivity is often episodic or slow (e.g., via groundwater), hydrologic\
        \ continuity and limited evaporative solute enrichment suggest both flow generation\
        \ and solute and sediment retention. Similarly, whereas biological connectivity\
        \ usually requires overland dispersal, numerous organisms, including many\
        \ rare or threatened species, use both GIWs and downstream waters at different\
        \ times or life stages, suggesting that GIWs are critical elements of landscape\
        \ habitat mosaics. Indeed, weaker hydrologic connectivity with downstream\
        \ waters and constrained biological connectivity with other landscape elements\
        \ are precisely what enhances some GIW functions and enables others. Based\
        \ on analysis of wetland geography and synthesis of wetland functions, we\
        \ argue that sustaining landscape functions requires conserving the entire\
        \ continuum of wetland connectivity, including GIWs.</span></p>\",\"language\"\

        \ and wetlands is critical for determining the resiliency of wetland systems\
        \ that protect adjacent habitat and communities. The wetland and back-barrier\
        \ shorelines of the New Jersey barrier islands were changed by wave action\
        \ and storm surge from Hurricane Sandy in 2012. The U.S. Geological Survey\
        \ Coastal and Marine Geology Program is assessing the impact of Hurricane\
        \ Sandy to understand its historical context and the vulnerability of wetland\
        \ systems. These assessments require data that document physical changes over\
        \ time, such as maps, aerial photographs, satellite imagery, and lidar elevation\
        \ data.</p>\\n<p>This Data Series Report includes open-ocean shorelines, back-island\
        \ shorelines, back-island shoreline points, sand polygons, and sand lines\
        \ for the undeveloped areas of New Jersey barrier islands. These data were\
        \ extracted from orthoimagery (aerial photography) taken between March 9,\
        \ 1991, and July 30, 2013. The images used were 0.3&ndash;1-meter (m)-resolution\

        \ The back-island shorelines were hand-digitized at the intersects of the\

        \ open-ocean shorelines were hand-digitized at the approximate still-water\
        \ level, such as tide level, which was fit through the average position of\
        \ waves and swash apparent on the beach. Hand-digitizing was done at a scale\
        \ of approximately 1:2,000. The sand polygons were derived by an image-processing\
        \ unsupervised classification technique that separates images into classes.\
        \ The classes were then visually categorized as either sand or not sand. Sand\
        \ lines were taken from the sand polygons. Also included in this report are\
        \ 20-m-spaced transect lines and the transect base lines.</p>\",\"language\"\

        :\"<p><span>Wild waterfowl are primary reservoirs of avian influenza viruses\
        \ (AIV). However the role of sea ducks in the ecology of avian influenza,\
        \ and how that role differs from freshwater ducks, has not been examined.\
        \ We obtained and analyzed sera from North Atlantic sea ducks and determined\
        \ the seroprevalence in those populations. We also tested swab samples from\
        \ North Atlantic sea ducks for the presence of AIV. We found relatively high\
        \ serological prevalence (61%) in these sea duck populations but low virus\
        \ prevalence (0.3%). Using these data we estimated that an antibody half-life\
        \ of 141 weeks (3.2 years) would be required to attain these prevalences.\
        \ These findings are much different than what is known in freshwater waterfowl\
        \ and have implications for surveillance efforts, AIV in marine environments,\
        \ and the roles of sea ducks and other long-lived waterfowl in avian influenza\

        \ restoration decisions\",\"docAbstract\":\"<p>Sagebrush steppe ecosystems\
        \ in the United States currently (2015) occur on only about one-half of their\
        \ historical land area because of changes in land use, urban growth, and degradation\
        \ of land, including invasions of non-native plants. The existence of many\
        \ animal species depends on the existence of sagebrush steppe habitat. The\
        \ greater sage-grouse (<i>Centrocercus urophasianus</i>) is a landscape-dependent\
        \ bird that requires intact habitat and combinations of sagebrush and perennial\
        \ grasses to exist. In addition, other sagebrush-obligate animals also have\
        \ similar requirements and restoration of landscapes for greater sage-grouse\
        \ also will benefit these animals. Once sagebrush lands are degraded, they\
        \ may require restoration actions to make those lands viable habitat for supporting\
        \ sagebrush-obligate animals.</p>\\n<p>Land managers do not have resources\
        \ to restore all locations because of the extent of the restoration need and\
        \ because some land uses are not likely to change, therefore, restoration\
        \ decisions made at the landscape to regional scale may improve the effectiveness\
        \ of restoration to achieve landscape and local restoration objectives. We\
        \ present a landscape restoration decision tool intended to assist decision\
        \ makers in determining landscape objectives, to identify and prioritize landscape\
        \ areas where sites for priority restoration projects might be located, and\
        \ to aid in ultimately selecting restoration sites guided by criteria used\
        \ to define the landscape objectives. The landscape restoration decision tool\
        \ is structured in five sections that should be addressed sequentially. Each\
        \ section has a primary question or statement followed by related questions\
        \ and statements to assist the user in addressing the primary question or\
        \ statement. This handbook will guide decision makers through the important\
        \ process steps of identifying appropriate questions, gathering appropriate\
        \ data, developing landscape objectives, and prioritizing landscape patches\
        \ where potential sites for restoration projects may be located. Once potential\
        \ sites are selected, land managers can move to the site-specific decision\
        \ tool to guide restoration decisions at the site level.</p>\",\"language\"\

        \ Toxicoses were less common and were dominated by lead poisoning or botulism.\

        :\"<p>Observations of elemental mercury (Hg<sup>0</sup>) at sites in North\
        \ America and Europe show large decreases (&sim;1&ndash;2% y<sup>&minus;1</sup>)\
        \ from 1990 to present. Observations in background northern hemisphere air,\
        \ including Mauna Loa Observatory (Hawaii) and CARIBIC (Civil Aircraft for\
        \ the Regular Investigation of the atmosphere Based on an Instrument Container)\
        \ aircraft flights, show weaker decreases (&lt;1% y<sup>&minus;1</sup>). These\
        \ decreases are inconsistent with current global emission inventories indicating\
        \ flat or increasing emissions over that period. However, the inventories\
        \ have three major flaws: (<i>i</i>) they do not account for the decline in\
        \ atmospheric release of Hg from commercial products; (<i>ii</i>) they are\
        \ biased in their estimate of artisanal and small-scale gold mining emissions;\
        \ and (<i>iii</i>) they do not properly account for the change in Hg<sup>0</sup>/Hg<sup>II</sup>&nbsp;speciation\
        \ of emissions from coal-fired utilities after implementation of emission\
        \ controls targeted at SO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;and NO<sub>x</sub>. We construct\
        \ an improved global emission inventory for the period 1990 to 2010 accounting\
        \ for the above factors and find a 20% decrease in total Hg emissions and\
        \ a 30% decrease in anthropogenic Hg<sup>0</sup>&nbsp;emissions, with much\
        \ larger decreases in North America and Europe offsetting the effect of increasing\
        \ emissions in Asia. Implementation of our inventory in a global 3D atmospheric\
        \ Hg simulation [GEOS-Chem (Goddard Earth Observing System-Chemistry)] coupled\
        \ to land and ocean reservoirs reproduces the observed large-scale trends\
        \ in atmospheric Hg<sup>0</sup>&nbsp;concentrations and in Hg<sup>II</sup>&nbsp;wet\
        \ deposition. The large trends observed in North America and Europe reflect\
        \ the phase-out of Hg from commercial products as well as the cobenefit from\

        :\"<p><span>Monkeypox is a zoonotic disease endemic to central and western\
        \ Africa, where it is a major public health concern. Although&nbsp;</span><i>Monkeypox\
        \ virus</i><span>&nbsp;(MPXV) and monkeypox disease in humans have been well\
        \ characterized, little is known about its natural history, or its maintenance\
        \ in animal populations of sylvatic reservoir(s). In 2003, several species\
        \ of rodents imported from Ghana were involved in a monkeypox outbreak in\
        \ the United States with individuals of three African rodent genera (</span><i>Cricetomys</i><span>,&nbsp;</span><i>Graphiurus</i><span>,&nbsp;</span><i>Funisciurus</i><span>)\
        \ shown to be infected with MPXV. Here, we examine the course of MPXV infection\
        \ in&nbsp;</span><i>Cricetomys gambianus</i><span>&nbsp;(pouched Gambian rats)\
        \ and this rodent species&rsquo; competence as a host for the virus. We obtained\
        \ ten Gambian rats from an introduced colony in Grassy Key, Florida and infected\
        \ eight of these via scarification with a challenge dose of 4X10</span><sup><span>4</span></sup><span>&nbsp;plaque\
        \ forming units (pfu) from either of the two primary clades of MPXV: Congo\
        \ Basin (C-MPXV: n = 4) or West African (W-MPXV: n = 4); an additional 2 animals\
        \ served as PBS controls. Viral shedding and the effect of infection on activity\
        \ and physiological aspects of the animals were measured. MPXV challenged\
        \ animals had significantly higher core body temperatures, reduced activity\
        \ and increased weight loss than PBS controls. Viable virus was found in samples\
        \ taken from animals in both experimental groups (C-MPXV and W-MPXV) between\
        \ 3 and 27 days post infection (p.i.) (up to 1X10</span><sup><span>8</span></sup><span>pfu/ml),\
        \ with viral DNA found until day 56 p.i. The results from this work show that&nbsp;</span><i>Cricetomys\
        \ gambianus</i><span>&nbsp;(and by inference, probably the closely related\
        \ species,&nbsp;</span><i>Cricetomys emini</i><span>) can be infected with\
        \ MPXV and shed viable virus particles; thus suggesting that these animals\
        \ may be involved in the maintenance of MPXV in wildlife mammalian populations.\
        \ More research is needed to elucidate the epidemiology of MPXV and the role\
        \ of Gambian rats and other species.</span></p>\",\"language\":\"English\"\

        \ and applying restoration\",\"docAbstract\":\"<p>Sagebrush steppe ecosystems\
        \ in the United States currently occur on only about one-half of their historical\
        \ land area because of changes in land use, urban growth, and degradation\
        \ of land, including invasions of non-native plants. The existence of many\
        \ animal species depends on the existence of sagebrush steppe habitat. The\
        \ greater sage-grouse (<i>Centrocercus urophasianus</i>) is a landscape-dependent\
        \ bird that requires intact habitat and combinations of sagebrush and perennial\
        \ grasses to exist. In addition, other sagebrush-obligate animals also have\
        \ similar requirements and restoration of landscapes for greater sage-grouse\
        \ also will benefit these animals. Once sagebrush lands are degraded, they\
        \ may require restoration actions to make those lands viable habitat for supporting\
        \ sagebrushobligate animals. This restoration handbook is the first in a three-part\
        \ series on restoration of sagebrush ecosystems. In Part 1, we discuss concepts\
        \ surrounding landscape and restoration ecology of sagebrush ecosystems and\
        \ greater sage-grouse that habitat managers and restoration practitioners\
        \ need to know to make informed decisions regarding where and how to restore\
        \ specific areas. We will describe the plant dynamics of sagebrush steppe\
        \ ecosystems and their responses to major disturbances, fire, and defoliation.\
        \ We will introduce the concepts of ecosystem resilience to disturbances and\
        \ resistance to invasions of annual grasses within sagebrush steppe. An introduction\
        \ to soils and ecological site information will provide insights into the\
        \ specific plants that can be restored in a location. Soil temperature and\
        \ moisture regimes are described as a tool for determining resilience and\
        \ resistance and the potential for various restoration actions. Greater sage-grouse\
        \ are considered landscape birds that require large areas of intact sagebrush\
        \ steppe; therefore, we describe concepts of landscape ecology that aid our\
        \ decisions regarding habitat restoration. We provide a brief overview of\
        \ restoration techniques for sage-grouse habitat restoration. We conclude\
        \ with a description of the critical nature of monitoring for adaptive management\
        \ of sagebrush steppe restoration at landscape- and project-specific levels.</p>\"\

        \ anniversary of the end of the American Civil War, a conflict that Abraham\
        \ Lincoln called a &ldquo;mighty scourge.&rdquo; It was one of the most poignant\
        \ periods in U.S. history, laying bare political, economic, social, and moral\
        \ divergence between Northern and Southern states. The cause of the divergence\
        \ that led to war was slavery [e.g.,&nbsp;<i>McPherson</i>, 1988, chap. 3]&mdash;an\
        \ institution that, by the 19th century, had been effectively abolished in\
        \ the North but remained firmly entrenched in the South.</p>\\n<p>War erupted\
        \ in 1861 after a confederacy of Southern states declared secession from the\
        \ Union of the United States. When the war finally ended in 1865, the Union\
        \ had prevailed, and afterward, slavery was abolished throughout the United\
        \ States. This outcome was obtained at the cost of 750,000 American lives\
        \ and substantial destruction, especially in the South [e.g.,&nbsp;<i>Gugliotta</i>,\
        \ 2012].</p>\\n<p>In 1865, the same year the war ended, the American landscape\
        \ artist Frederic Edwin Church unveiled<i>Aurora Borealis</i>&nbsp;(pictured\
        \ above), a dramatic and mysterious painting that can be interpreted in terms\
        \ of 19th century romanticism, scientific philosophy, and Arctic missions\
        \ of exploration.&nbsp;<i>Aurora Borealis</i>can also be viewed as a restrained\
        \ tribute to the end of the Civil War&mdash;a moving example of how science\
        \ and current events served as the muses of late romantic artists [e.g.,&nbsp;<i>Carr</i>,\
        \ 1994, p. 277;&nbsp;<i>Avery</i>, 2011;&nbsp;<i>Harvey</i>, 2012].</p>\"\

        \ will require expansion of the prevailing water resources management paradigm\
        \ beyond narrow economic criteria to include socially valued ecosystem functions\

        \ stakeholder-defined engineering and ecological performance metrics across\
        \ a range of possible management actions under unknown future hydrological\
        \ and climate states. We illustrate its potential application through a hypothetical\
        \ case study of the Iowa River, USA. EEDS holds promise as a powerful framework\
        \ for operationalizing freshwater sustainability under future hydrological\
        \ uncertainty by fostering collaboration across historically conflicting perspectives\

        \ reintroduced Canada goose (<i>Branta canadensis</i>) population in Arkansas\
        \ has grown in range and abundance in recent decades. We determined the geographic\
        \ range of Arkansas resident Canada geese from 2004 to 2012 using volume contour\
        \ maps from citizen science observations using eBird, a citizen science website,\
        \ and hunter recovery locations from the U.S. Geological Survey Bird Banding\
        \ Laboratory. Resulting maps indicate an increase in Canada goose encounters\
        \ toward northwestern and southwestern Arkansas from the original relocations\
        \ in the Arkansas River valley. We examined movement of Canada geese banded\
        \ and recovered in Arkansas by determining the distance and angle of movement\
        \ between initial and final encounter locations; 25% moved east, and 17% went\
        \ west. The average distance moved from banding to recovery was 50 km (SE\
        \ = 1 km). Recoveries of Canada geese banded in Arkansas were greatest in\
        \ the Mississippi Flyway (58% of all geese) followed by the Central Flyway\
        \ (37%) with some representation in both the Atlantic (4%) and Pacific flyways\
        \ (0.9%). Movement from Arkansas to other states and Canada was influenced\
        \ by goose age and sex. Older individuals traveled longer distances than younger\
        \ ones, and females traveled longer distances than males. Our findings suggest\
        \ that recently established Canada geese in Arkansas have slowly expanded\
        \ within the state to the northwest and southwest with the expansion to the\
        \ east being important now. Movement of Arkansas resident Canada geese on\
        \ molt-migration can contribute to management issues in other states and provinces.</p>\"\

        \"abstract svAbstract \\\" data-etype=\\\"ab\\\">\\n<p id=\\\"sp0005\\\">The\
        \ Betsie Shale Member is a relatively thick and continuous unit that serves\
        \ as a marker bed across the central Appalachian basin, in part because it\
        \ includes an organic-rich shale unit at its base that is observable in drill\
        \ logs. Deposited during a marine transgression, the Betsie Shale Member has\
        \ been correlated to units in both Wales and Germany and has been proposed\
        \ to mark the boundary between the Lower and Middle Pennsylvanian Series within\
        \ North America. This investigation assigns a new Re&ndash;Os date to the\
        \ base of the Betsie and examines the palynoflora and maceral composition\
        \ of the underlying Matewan coal bed in the context of that date. The Matewan\
        \ coal bed contains abundant lycopsid tree spores along its base with assemblage\
        \ diversity and inertinite content increasing upsection, as sulfur content\
        \ and ash yield decrease. Taken together, these palynologic and organic petrographic\
        \ results suggest a submerged paleomire that transitioned to an exposed peat\
        \ surface. Notably, separating the lower and upper benches of the Matewan\
        \ is a parting with very high sulfur content (28&nbsp;wt.%), perhaps representing\
        \ an early marine pulse prior to the full on transgression responsible for\
        \ depositing the Betsie. Results from Re&ndash;Os geochronology date the base\
        \ of the Betsie at 323&nbsp;&plusmn;&nbsp;7.8&nbsp;Ma, consistent with previously\
        \ determined age constraints as well as the palynoflora assemblage presented\
        \ herein. The Betsie Shale Member is also highly enriched in Re (ranging from\
        \ 319.7 to 1213&nbsp;ng/g), with high&nbsp;<sup>187</sup>Re/<sup>188</sup>Os\
        \ values ranging from 3644 to 5737 likely resultant from varying redox conditions\
        \ between the pore water and overlying water column during deposition and\
        \ early condensing of the section.</p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n</div>\",\"language\"\

        \ offer crucial habitat for North America&rsquo;s waterfowl populations. The\
        \ wetlands also support an abundance of other species and provide ecological\
        \ services valued by society. The hydrology of prairie pothole wetlands is\
        \ dependent on atmospheric interactions. Therefore, changes to the region&rsquo;s\
        \ climate can have profound effects on wetland hydrology. The relevant literature\
        \ related to climate change and upland management effects on prairie pothole\
        \ wetland water levels and hydroperiods was reviewed. Climate change is widely\
        \ expected to affect water levels and hydroperiods of prairie pothole wetlands,\
        \ as well as the biota and ecological services that the wetlands support.\
        \ In general, hydrologic model projections that incorporate future climate\
        \ change scenarios forecast lower water levels in prairie pothole wetlands\
        \ and longer periods spent in a dry condition, despite potential increases\
        \ in precipitation. However, the extreme natural variability in climate and\
        \ hydrology of prairie pothole wetlands necessitates caution when interpreting\
        \ model results. Recent changes in weather patterns throughout much of the\
        \ Prairie Pothole Region have been in increased precipitation that results\
        \ in increased water inputs to wetlands above losses associated with warmer\
        \ temperatures. However, observed precipitation increases are within the range\
        \ of natural climate variability and therefore, may not persist. Identifying\
        \ management techniques with the potential to affect water inputs to prairie\
        \ pothole wetlands would provide increased options for managers when dealing\
        \ with the uncertainties associated with a changing climate. Several grassland\
        \ management techniques (for example, grazing and burning) have the potential\
        \ to affect water levels and hydroperiods of prairie pothole by affecting\
        \ infiltration, evapotranspiration, and snow deposition.</span></p>\",\"language\"\

        :\"<p>This report describes a series of geoelectrical soundings carried out\
        \ on and near Mount St. Helens volcano, Washington, in 2010&ndash;2011. These\
        \ soundings used a controlled-source audio-frequency magnetotelluric (CSAMT)\
        \ approach (Zonge and Hughes, 1991; Simpson and Bahr, 2005). We chose CSAMT\
        \ for logistical reasons: It can be deployed by helicopter, has an effective\
        \ depth of penetration of as much as 1 kilometer, and requires less wire than\
        \ a Schlumberger sounding.</p>\\n<p>This Data Series provides the edited data\
        \ for these CSAMT soundings as well as several different types of 1-D inversions\
        \ (where the signal data are converted to conductivity-versus-depth models).\
        \ In addition, we include a map showing station locations on and around the\
        \ volcano and the Pumice Plain to the north.</p>\\n<p>The apparent conductivity\
        \ (or its inverse, apparent resistivity) measured by a geoelectrical system\
        \ is caused by several factors. The most important of these are water-filled\
        \ rock porosity and the presence of water-filled fractures; however, rock\
        \ type and minerals (for instance, sulfides and clay content) also contribute\
        \ to apparent conductivity. In situations with little recharge (for instance,\
        \ in arid regions), variations in ionic content of water occupying pore space\
        \ and fractures sampled by the measurement system must also be factored in\
        \ (Wynn, 2006). Variations in ionic content may also be present in hydrothermal\
        \ fluids surrounding volcanoes in wet regions. In unusual cases, temperature\
        \ may also affect apparent conductivity (Keller, 1989; Palacky, 1989). There\
        \ is relatively little hydrothermal alteration (and thus fewer clay minerals\
        \ that might add to the apparent conductivity) in the eruptive products of\
        \ Mount St. Helens (Reid and others, 2010), so conductors observed in the\
        \ Fischer, Occam, and Marquardt inversion results later in this report are\
        \ thus believed to map zones with significant water content. Geoelectrical\
        \ surveys thus have the potential to reveal subsurface regions with significant\
        \ groundwater content, including perched and regional aquifers. Reid and others\
        \ (2001) and Reid (2004) have suggested that groundwater involvement may figure\
        \ in both the scale and the character of some if not all volcanic edifice\
        \ collapse events. Ongoing research by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and\
        \ others aims to better understand the contribution of groundwater to both\
        \ edifice pore pressure and rock alteration as well as its direct influence\
        \ on eruption processes by violent interaction with magma (Schmincke, 1998).</p>\"\

        \ of acoustic emissions and other extremely small seismic events. Unlike previous\
        \ calibration techniques, it does not require modeling of the wave propagation,\
        \ sensor response, or signal conditioning. Rather, this technique calibrates\
        \ the recording system as a whole and uses a ball impact as a reference source\
        \ or empirical Green\u2019s function. To correctly apply this technique, we\
        \ develop mathematical expressions that link the seismic moment $M_{0}$ of\
        \ internal seismic sources (i.e., earthquakes and acoustic emissions) to the\
        \ impulse, or change in momentum $\\\\Delta p $, of externally applied seismic\
        \ sources (i.e., meteor impacts or, in this case, ball impact). We find that,\
        \ at low frequencies, moment and impulse are linked by a constant, which we\
        \ call the force\u2010moment\u2010rate scale factor $C_{F\\\\dot{M}} = M_{0}/\\\
        \\Delta p$. This constant is equal to twice the speed of sound in the material\
        \ from which the seismic sources were generated. Next, we demonstrate the\
        \ calibration technique on two different experimental rock mechanics facilities.\
        \ The first example is a saw\u2010cut cylindrical granite sample that is loaded\
        \ in a triaxial apparatus at 40&nbsp;MPa confining pressure. The second example\
        \ is a 2&nbsp;m long fault cut in a granite sample and deformed in a large\
        \ biaxial apparatus at lower stress levels. Using the empirical calibration\
        \ technique, we are able to determine absolute source parameters including\
        \ the seismic moment, corner frequency, stress drop, and radiated energy of\

        \ Arm near Girdwood, Alaska subsided 1.7&nbsp;&plusmn;&nbsp;0.1&nbsp;m based\

        \ equivalent sudden relative sea-level (RSL) rise that is stratigraphically\
        \ preserved as mud-over-peat contacts where intertidal silt buried peaty marsh\
        \ surfaces. Changes in intertidal microfossil assemblages across these contacts\
        \ have been used to estimate subsidence in 1964 by applying quantitative microfossil\
        \ transfer functions to reconstruct corresponding RSL rise. Here, we review\
        \ the use of organic stable C and N isotope values and C</span><sub>org</sub><span>:N</span><sub>tot</sub><span>&nbsp;ratios\
        \ as alternative proxies for reconstructing coseismic RSL changes, and report\
        \ independent estimates of subsidence in 1964 by using &delta;</span><sup>13</sup><span>C\
        \ values from intertidal sediment to assess RSL change caused by the earthquake.\
        \ We observe that surface sediment &delta;</span><sup>13</sup><span>C values\
        \ systematically decrease by &sim;4&permil; over the &sim;2.5&nbsp;m increase\
        \ in elevation along three 60- to 100-m-long transects extending from intertidal\
        \ mud flat to upland environments. We use a straightforward linear regression\
        \ to quantify the relationship between modern sediment &delta;</span><sup>13</sup><span>C\
        \ values and elevation (</span><i>n</i><span>&nbsp;=&nbsp;84,&nbsp;</span><i>R</i><sup>2</sup><span>&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.56).\
        \ The linear regression provides a slope&ndash;intercept equation used to\
        \ reconstruct the paleoelevation of the site before and after the earthquake\
        \ based on &delta;</span><sup>13</sup><span>C values in sandy silt above and\
        \ herbaceous peat below the 1964 contact. The regression standard error (average&nbsp;=&nbsp;&plusmn;0.59&permil;)\
        \ reflects the modern isotopic variability at sites of similar surface elevation,\
        \ and is equivalent to an uncertainty of &plusmn;0.4&nbsp;m elevation with\
        \ respect to Mean Higher High Water. To reduce potential errors in paleoelevation\
        \ and subsidence estimates, we analyzed multiple sediment &delta;</span><sup>13</sup><span>C\
        \ values in nine cores on a shore-perpendicular transect at Bird Point. Our\
        \ method estimates 1.3&nbsp;&plusmn;&nbsp;0.4&nbsp;m of coseismic RSL rise\

        \ leveling in Turnagain Arm, and from microfossil transfer functions at Girdwood\
        \ (1.50&nbsp;&plusmn;&nbsp;0.32&nbsp;m). While our results support the use\
        \ of bulk organic &delta;</span><sup>13</sup><span>C for reconstructing RSL\
        \ change in southern Alaska, the variability of stable isotope values in modern\
        \ and buried intertidal sediment required the analysis of multiple samples\

        \">St. Petersburg Coastal and Marine Science Center</a>&nbsp;collected sediment\
        \ samples from the northern Chandeleur Islands in July 2013. The overall objective\
        \ of this project, which integrates geophysical (bathymetric, seismic, and\
        \ topographic) and sedimentologic data, is to better understand the depositional\
        \ and erosional processes that drive the morphologic evolution of barrier\
        \ islands over annual to interannual timescales (1 to 5 years). Between June\
        \ 2010 and April 2011, in response to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, the\
        \ State of Louisiana constructed a sand berm extending more than 14 kilometers\
        \ along the northern Chandeleur Islands platform. The construction of the\
        \ berm provided a unique opportunity to investigate how this new sediment\
        \ source will interact with and affect the morphologic evolution of the barrier-island\
        \ system. Data collected from this study will be used to describe differences\
        \ in the physical characteristics and spatial distribution of sediments both\
        \ along the axis of the berm and also along transects across the berm and\
        \ onto the adjacent barrier island. Comparison of these data with data from\
        \ previous sampling efforts will provide information about sediment interactions\
        \ and movement between the berm and the natural island platform, improving\
        \ our understanding of short-term morphologic change and processes in this\
        \ barrier-island system.</p>\\n<p>This data series serves as an archive of\
        \ sediment data collected in July 2013 from the Chandeleur Islands sand berm\
        \ and adjacent barrier-island environments. Data products include descriptive\
        \ core logs, core photographs and x-radiographs, results of sediment grain-size\
        \ analyses, sample location maps, and Geographic Information System data files\

        :\"<p>The national seismic hazard maps for the conterminous United States\
        \ have been updated to account for new methods, models, and data that have\
        \ been obtained since the 2008 maps were released (Petersen and others, 2008).\
        \ The input models are improved from those implemented in 2008 by using new\
        \ ground motion models that have incorporated about twice as many earthquake\
        \ strong ground shaking data and by incorporating many additional scientific\
        \ studies that indicate broader ranges of earthquake source and ground motion\
        \ models. These time-independent maps are shown for 2-percent and 10-percent\
        \ probability of exceedance in 50 years for peak horizontal ground acceleration\
        \ as well as 5-hertz and 1-hertz spectral accelerations with 5-percent damping\
        \ on a uniform firm rock site condition (760 meters per second shear wave\
        \ velocity in the upper 30 m, V<sub>S30</sub>). In this report, the 2014 updated\
        \ maps are compared with the 2008 version of the maps and indicate changes\
        \ of plus or minus 20 percent over wide areas, with larger changes locally,\
        \ caused by the modifications to the seismic source and ground motion inputs.</p>\"\

        \ than previously projected and is expected to virtually disappear before\
        \ mid-century. This is altering marine ecosystems and leading to greater ship\
        \ access, offshore development opportunity, and increased community vulnerability\
        \ to coastal erosion.</li>\\n<li>Most glaciers in Alaska and British Columbia\
        \ are shrinking substantially. This trend is expected to continue and has\
        \ implications for hydropower production, ocean circulation patterns, fisheries,\
        \ and global sea level rise.</li>\\n<li>Permafrost temperatures in Alaska\
        \ are rising, a thawing trend that is expected to continue, causing multiple\
        \ vulnerabilities through drier landscapes, more wildfire, altered wildlife\
        \ habitat, increased cost of maintaining infrastructure, and the release of\
        \ heat-trapping gases that increase climate warming.</li>\\n<li>Current and\
        \ projected increases in Alaska&rsquo;s ocean temperatures and changes in\
        \ ocean chemistry are expected to alter the distribution and productivity\
        \ of Alaska&rsquo;s marine fisheries, which lead the U.S. in commercial value.</li>\\\
        n<li>The cumulative effects of climate change in Alaska strongly affect Native\
        \ communities, which are highly vulnerable to these rapid changes but have\
        \ a deep cultural history of adapting to change.</li>\\n</ol>\",\"largerWorkType\"\

        \ Francisco Bay is the hub of a dynamic estuarine system connecting the San\
        \ Joaquin and Sacramento River Deltas, Suisun Bay, and San Pablo Bay to the\
        \ Pacific Ocean and South San Francisco Bay. To understand the role that Central\
        \ San Francisco Bay plays in sediment transport throughout the system, it\
        \ is necessary to first determine historical changes in patterns of sediment\
        \ deposition and erosion from both natural and anthropogenic forces. The first\
        \ extensive hydrographic survey of Central San Francisco Bay was conducted\
        \ in 1853 by the National Ocean Service (NOS) (formerly the United States\
        \ Coast and Geodetic Survey (USCGS)). From 1894 to 1979, four additional surveys,\
        \ composed of a total of approximately 700,000 bathymetric soundings, were\
        \ collected within Central San Francisco Bay. Converting these soundings into\
        \ accurate bathymetric models involved many steps. The soundings were either\
        \ hand digitized directly from the original USCGS and NOS hydrographic sheets\
        \ (H-sheets) or obtained digitally from the National Geophysical Data Center's\
        \ (NGDC) Geophysical Data System (GEODAS) (National Geophysical Data Center,\
        \ 1996). Soundings were supplemented with contours that were either taken\
        \ directly from the H-sheets or added in by hand. Shorelines and marsh areas\
        \ were obtained from topographic sheets. The digitized soundings, depth contours,\
        \ shorelines, and marsh areas were entered into a geographic information system\
        \ (GIS) and georeferenced to a common horizontal datum. Using surface modeling\
        \ software, bathymetric grids with a horizontal resolution of 25 m were developed\
        \ for each of the five hydrographic surveys. Before analyses of sediment deposition\
        \ and erosion were conducted, interpolation bias was removed and all of the\
        \ grids were converted to a common vertical datum. These bathymetric grids\
        \ were then used to develop bathymetric change maps for subsequent survey\
        \ periods and to determine long-term changes in deposition and erosion by\
        \ calculating volumes and rates of net sediment change. Central San Francisco\
        \ Bay experienced periods of both deposition and erosion, but overall experienced\
        \ a net gain in sediment from 1855 to 1979 of approximately 42x106 m3 (0.33x106\
        \ m3 / yr). Over this same time period, 92 percent of the tidal marsh and\
        \ 69 percent of the intertidal mudflats were lost as human activity increased\
        \ and the shorefront was developed. During the first time period, from 1855\
        \ to 1895, Central San Francisco Bay was erosional, losing roughly 2x106 m3\
        \ / yr of sediment. The next time period was depositional, with a net gain\

        :\"<p>A key question in salt pond restoration in South San Francisco Bay is\
        \ whether sediment sinks created by opening ponds will result in the loss\
        \ of intertidal flats. Analyses of a series of bathymetric surveys of South\
        \ San Francisco Bay made from 1858 to 2005 reveal changes in intertidal flat\
        \ area in both space and time that can be used to better understand the pre-restoration\
        \ system. This analysis also documents baseline conditions of intertidal flats\
        \ that may be altered by restoration efforts. From 1858 to 2005, intertidal\
        \ flat area decreased by about 25% from 69.2 +6.4/-7.6 km2 to 51.2 +4.8/-5.8\
        \ km2. Intertidal flats in the north tended to decrease in area during the\
        \ period of this study whereas those south of Dumbarton Bridge were either\
        \ stable or increased in area. From 1983 to 2005, intertidal flats south of\
        \ Dumbarton Bridge increased from 17.6 +1.7/-2.5 km2 to 24.2 +1.0/-1.8 km2.\
        \ Intertidal flats along the east shore of the bay tended to be more erosional\
        \ and decreased in area while those along the west shore of the bay did not\
        \ significantly change in area. Loss of intertidal flats occurred intermittently\
        \ along the eastern shore of the bay north of the Dumbarton Bridge. There\
        \ was little or no loss from 1931 to 1956 and from 1983 to 2005. Predictions\
        \ of future change in intertidal flat area that do not account for this spatial\
        \ and temporal variability are not likely to be accurate. The causes of the\
        \ spatial and temporal variability in intertidal flat area in South San Francisco\
        \ Bay are not fully understood, but appear related to energy available to\
        \ erode sediments, sediment redistribution from north to south in the bay,\
        \ and sediment available to deposit on the flats. Improved understanding of\
        \ sediment input to South San Francisco Bay, especially from Central Bay,\
        \ how it is likely to change in the future, the redistribution of sediment\
        \ within the bay, and ultimately its effect on intertidal flat area would\
        \ aid in the management of restoration of South San Francisco Bay salt ponds.</p>\"\

        \ to best develop restoration strategies, as well as to track morphologic\
        \ change throughout the restoration process, a topographic lidar survey was\
        \ conducted in May of 2004. The survey collected more than 250 million elevation\

        \ Bay: 1858-1983\",\"docAbstract\":\"<p>Since the California Gold Rush of\
        \ 1849, sediment deposition, erosion, and the bathymetry of South San Francisco\
        \ Bay have been altered by both natural processes and human activities. Historical\
        \ hydrographic surveys can be used to assess how this system has evolved over\
        \ the past 150 years. The National Ocean Service (NOS) (formerly the United\
        \ States Coast and Geodetic Survey (USCGS), collected five hydrographic surveys\
        \ of South San Francisco Bay from 1858 to 1983. Analysis of these surveys\
        \ enables us to reconstruct the surface of the bay floor for each time period\
        \ and quantify spatial and temporal changes in deposition, erosion, and bathymetry.\
        \ The creation of accurate bathymetric models involves many steps. Sounding\
        \ data was obtained from the original USCGS and NOS hydrographic sheets and\
        \ were supplemented with hand drawn depth contours. Shorelines and marsh areas\
        \ were obtained from topographic sheets. The digitized soundings and shorelines\
        \ were entered into a Geographic Information System (GIS), and georeferenced\
        \ to a common horizontal datum. Using surface modeling software, bathymetric\
        \ grids with a horizontal resolution of 50 m were developed for each of the\
        \ five hydrographic surveys. Prior to conducting analyses of sediment deposition\
        \ and erosion, we converted all of the grids to a common vertical datum and\
        \ made adjustments to correct for land subsidence that occurred from 1934\
        \ to 1967. Deposition and erosion that occurred during consecutive periods\
        \ was then computed by differencing the corrected grids. From these maps of\
        \ deposition and erosion, we calculated volumes and rates of net sediment\
        \ change in the bay. South San Francisco Bay has lost approximately 90 x 106\
        \ m3 of sediment from 1858 to 1983; however within this timeframe there have\
        \ been periods of both deposition and erosion. During the most recent period,\
        \ from 1956 to 1983, sediment loss approached 3 x 106 m3/yr. One of the most\
        \ striking changes that occurred from 1858 to 1983 was the conversion of more\
        \ than 80% of the tidal marsh to salt ponds, agricultural, and urban areas.\
        \ In addition, there has been a decline of approximately 40% in intertidal\
        \ mud flat area. Restoration of these features will require a detailed understanding\
        \ of the morphology and sediment sources of this complex system.</p>\",\"\

        \ data represent that part of the National Water Data System operated by the\
        \ U.S. Geological Survey and cooperating local, State, and Federal agencies\
        \ in Iowa.<br />Records of discharge or stage of streams, and contents or\
        \ stage of lakes and reservoirs were first published in a series of U.S. Geological\
        \ Survey water-supply papers entitled &ldquo;Surface Water Supply of the United\
        \ States.&rdquo; Through September 30, 1960, these water-supply papers were\
        \ published in an annual series; during 1961-65 and 1966-70, they were published\
        \ in 5- year series. Records of chemical quality, water temperatures, and\
        \ suspended sediment were published from 1941 to 1970 in an annual series\
        \ of water-supply papers entitled &ldquo;Quality of Surface Waters of the\
        \ United States.&rdquo; Records of ground-water levels were published from\
        \ 1935 to 1974 in a series of water-supply papers entitled &ldquo;Ground-Water\
        \ Levels in the United States.&rdquo; Water-supply papers may be consulted\
        \ in the libraries of the principal cities in the United States, or they may\
        \ be purchased from Books and Open-File Reports Section, Federal Center, Box\
        \ 25425, Denver, Colorado 80225. <br />For water years 1961 through 1970,\
        \ streamflow data were released by the Geological Survey in annual reports\
        \ on a State-boundary basis. Water-quality records for water years 1964 through\
        \ 1970 were similarly released either in separate reports or in conjunction\
        \ with streamflow records. <br />Beginning with the 1971 water year, water\
        \ data for streamflow, water quality, and ground water is published in official\
        \ U.S. Geological Survey reports on a State-boundary basis. These official\
        \ reports carry an identification number consisting of the two-letter State\
        \ postal abbreviation, the last two digits of the water year, and the volume\

        \ Iowa, area provides large quantities of good quality ground water for municipal,\
        \ industrial, and agricultural supplies. Three municipal well fields for the\
        \ City of Muscatine produce a total of about 27 million gallons per day from\
        \ the alluvium. A previously published steady-state ground-water flow model\
        \ was modified, and results from the model were used with particle-tracking\
        \ software to delineate approximate areas contributing recharge to Muscatine\
        \ Power and Water municipal supply wells and to determine zones of transport\
        \ within the areas contributing recharge. </p>\\n<p>Under steady-state conditions\
        \ and 1998 pumpage, primary sources of inflow to the ground-water flow system\
        \ are recharge through infiltration of precipitation and upland runoff (53\
        \ percent) and Mississippi River leakage (41 percent). The primary components\
        \ of outflow from the ground-water flow system are pumpage (39.6 percent),\
        \ flow to drainage ditches in Illinois (32.9 percent), and Muscatine Slough\
        \ leakage (24.7 percent). </p>\\n<p>Several sources of water are present within\
        \ estimated areas contributing recharge to Muscatine Power and Water municipal\
        \ well fields including ground water from the alluvial aquifer, Mississippi\
        \ River water, and recharge originating as runoff from two unnamed creeks\
        \ in the northern part of the study area. Recharge originating from the Mississippi\
        \ River accounts for about 46 percent of the total water discharged from the\
        \ municipal well fields. The average simulated traveltime of particles tracked\
        \ from recharge to discharge at the municipal well fields was 13.6 years.\
        \ Particle-tracking results illustrate the influence of nearby industrial\
        \ supply wells on the shape and size of the area contributing recharge to\
        \ Muscatine Power and Water wells. Two large embayments into the area contributing\
        \ recharge to municipal wells are present along the Mississippi River. These\
        \ areas represent ground water that is unavailable to municipal wells due\
        \ to withdrawals by industrial supply wells. Recharge originating from the\
        \ Mississippi River accounts for about 98 percent of the total water discharged\
        \ from the Muscatine Power and Water Main well field. However, recharge originating\
        \ from the Mississippi River accounts for less of the total discharge from\
        \ the Progress Park and Grandview municipal well fields (12 and 34 percent,\
        \ respectively). </p>\\n<p>The effects of changing climatic conditions on\
        \ the size and shape of the 10-year zone of transport to Muscatine Power and\
        \ Water municipal well fields were simulated by decreasing and increasing\
        \ recharge from precipitation to the ground-water model to demonstrate the\
        \ variability inherent in delineating these areas. Locations of potential\
        \ sources of contamination within the zones of transport also are identified.</p>\"\

        \ at Whitehorse, Y.T. When the sexes are examined separately, slightly more\
        \ females are infected than males (29% vs 22%). The percent of fish exhibiting\
        \ clinical signs (diseased) is 2-3% when they enter the river, but increases\
        \ to over 20% at river mile 715 near Tanana, AK. Disease prevalence within\

        \ the percent of diseased fish drops to &lt;9% at Whitehorse. When the sexes\
        \ are examined separately, male disease prevalence is highest at Tanana (22.6%)\

        \ city of Newton, Iowa, conducted an investigation of the ground-water resources\
        \ of Jasper County, Iowa, near Newton during 1999-2001. The purpose of the\
        \ investigation was to provide additional information on the South Skunk River\
        \ alluvial aquifer from which Newton obtains its present municipal supply\
        \ and to summarize the available information on other groundwater resources\
        \ in the county.</p>\\n<p>The South Skunk River alluvial aquifer consists\
        \ of unconsolidated deposits of sand and gravel of glacial and fluvial origin.\
        \ These deposits overlie bedrock composed primarily of shale and limestone\
        \ of Pennsylvanian or Mississippian age. Information on the South Skunk River\
        \ alluvial aquifer and other Jasper County alluvial aquifers is limited to\
        \ a few test holes in a few locations. Additional thickness and lithologic\
        \ information was collected using seismic refraction and test hole drilling\
        \ to increase the understanding of the South Skunk River alluvial aquifer\
        \ near Newton. Water-level and water-quality information also was collected.</p>\\\
        n<p>The alluvial deposits along the South Skunk River near Newton range from\
        \ less than 30 to more than 60 feet thick. Three areas of deposits exceeding\
        \ 60 feet thick occur near the present city of Newton well field about 5,000\
        \ feet west of the present well field, at the present well field, and about\
        \ 5,000 feet southeast of the present well field.</p>\\n<p>Ground water in\
        \ the South Skunk River alluvial aquifer near the Newton well field flows\
        \ toward the municipal well field. Ground-water levels on the well-field side\
        \ of the South Skunk River were lower than water levels in the river, indicating\
        \ flow from the river toward the well field.</p>\\n<p>The water quality in\
        \ the South Skunk River and the alluvial aquifer was similar, except most\
        \ ground-water samples contained low dissolved oxygen concentrations. The\
        \ low dissolved-oxygen concentrations in ground water resulted in high concentrations\

        and during selected storm events from March 1996 through September 1998 to
        assess the occurrence, distribution, and transport of nitrogen, phosphorus,
        suspended sediment, and organic carbon as part of the U.S. Geological Survey&rsquo;s
        National Water-Quality Assessment Program. One site was dropped from monthly
        sampling after 1996. Dissolved nitrogen and phosphorus were detected in every
        water sample collected. Nitrate accounted for 92 percent of the total dissolved
        nitrogen. About 22 percent of the samples had nitrate concentrations that
        exceeded the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency&rsquo;s maximum contaminant
        level of 10 milligrams per liter as nitrogen for drinking-water regulations.
        The median concentration of total dissolved nitrogen for surface water in
        the study unit was 7.2 milligrams per liter. The median total phosphorus concentration
        for the study unit was 0.22 milligram per liter. About 75 percent of the total
        phosphorus concentrations exceeded the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
        recommended total phosphorus concentration of 0.10 milligram per liter or
        less to minimize algal growth. Median suspended sediment and dissolved organic-carbon
        concentrations for the study unit were 82 and 3.5 milligrams per liter, respectively.</p>\n<p>Median
        concentrations of nitrogen, phosphorus, and suspended sediment varied annually
        and seasonally. Nitrogen, phosphorus, and suspended-sediment concentrations
        increased each year of the study due to increased precipitation and runoff.
        Median concentrations of dissolved organic carbon were constant from 1996
        to 1998. Nitrogen concentrations were typically higher in the spring after
        fertilizer application and runoff. During winter, nitrogen concentrations
        typically increased when there was little in-stream processing by biota. Nitrogen
        and phosphorus concentrations decreased in late summer when there was less
        runoff and in-stream processing of nitrogen and phosphorus was high. Dissolved
        organic carbon was highest in February and March when decaying vegetation
        and manure were transported during snowmelt. Suspendedsediment concentrations
        were highest in early summer (May&ndash;June) during runoff and lowest in
        January when there was ice cover with very little overland flow contributing
        to rivers and streams. Based on historical and study-unit data, eastern Iowa
        streams and rivers are impacted by both nonpoint and point-source pollution.</p>\n<p>Indicator
        sites that have homogeneous land use, and geology had samples with significantly
        higher concentrations of total dissolved nitrogen (median, 8.2 milligrams
        per liter) than did samples from integrator sites (median, 6.2 milligrams
        per liter) that were more heterogeneous in land use and geology. Samples from
        integrator sites typically had significantly higher total phosphorus and suspended-sediment
        concentrations than did samples from indicator sites. Typically, there was
        very little difference in median dissolved organic-carbon concentrations in
        samples from indicator and integrator sites.</p>\n<p>Concentrations of nitrogen
        and phosphorus varied across the study unit due to land use and physiography.
        Basins that are located in areas with a higher percentage of row-crop agriculture
        typically had samples with higher nitrogen concentrations. Basins that drain
        the Southern Iowa Drift Plain and the Des Moines Lobe typically had samples
        with higher total phosphorus and suspended-sediment concentrations.</p>\n<p>Total
        nitrogen loads increased each year from 1996 through 1998 in conjunction with
        increased concentrations and runoff. Total phosphorus loads in the Skunk River
        Basin decreased in 1997 due to less runoff and decreased sediment transport,
        but increased in 1998 due to higher runoff and increased sediment transport.
        Total nitrogen and total phosphorus loads varied seasonally. The highest loads
        typically occurred in early spring and summer after fertilizer application
        and runoff. Loads were lowest in January and September when there was typically
        very little runoff to transport nitrogen and phosphorus in the soil to the
        rivers and streams.</p>\n<p>Total nitrogen loads contributed to the Mississippi
        River from the Eastern Iowa Basins during 1996, 1997, and 1998 were 97,600,
        120,000, and 234,000 metric tons, respectively. Total phosphorus loads contributed
        to the Mississippi River from the Eastern Iowa Basins during 1996, 1997, and
        1998 were 6,860, 4,550, and 8,830 metric tons, respectively. Suspendedsediment
        loads contributed to the Mississippi River from the Eastern Iowa Basins during
        1996, 1997, and 1998 were 7,480,000, 4,450,000, and 8,690,000 metric tons,
        respectively. The highest total nitrogen and total phosphorus yields typically
        occurred in samples from indicator sites. Sampling sites located in drainage
        basins with higher row-crop percentage typically had higher nitrogen and phosphorus
        yields. Sites that were located in the Des Moines Lobe and the Southern Iowa
        Drift Plain typically had higher phosphorus yields, probably due to physiographic
        features (for example, erodible soils, steeper slopes).</p>\n<p>Synoptic samples
        collected during low and high base flow had nitrogen, phosphorus, and organic-carbon
        concentrations that varied spatially and seasonally. Comparisons of water-quality
        data from six basic-fixed sampling sites and 19 other synoptic sites suggest
        that the water-quality data from basic-fixed sampling sites were representative
        of the entire study unit during periods of low and high base flow when most
        streamflow originates from ground water.</p>","language":"English","publisher":"U.S.

        for estimating flood-frequency discharges for streams in Iowa","docAbstract":"<p>A
        statewide study was conducted to develop regression equations for estimating
        flood-frequency discharges for ungaged stream sites in Iowa. Thirty-eight
        selected basin characteristics were quantified and flood-frequency analyses
        were computed for 291 streamflow-gaging stations in Iowa and adjacent States.
        A generalized-skew-coefficient analysis was conducted to determine whether
        generalized skew coefficients could be improved for Iowa. Station skew coefficients
        were computed for 239 gaging stations in Iowa and adjacent States, and an
        isoline map of generalized-skew-coefficient values was developed for Iowa
        using variogram modeling and kriging methods. The skew map provided the lowest
        mean square error for the generalized-skew- coefficient analysis and was used
        to revise generalized skew coefficients for flood-frequency analyses for gaging
        stations in Iowa.</p>\n<p>Regional regression analysis, using generalized
        least-squares regression and data from 241 gaging stations,was used to develop
        equations for three hydrologic regions defined for the State. The regression
        equations can be used to estimate flood discharges that have recurrence intervals
        of 2, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 200, and 500 years for ungaged stream sites in Iowa.
        One-variable equations were developed for each of the three regions and multi-variable
        equations were developed for two of the regions. Two sets of equations are
        presented for two of the regions because one-variable equations are considered
        easy for users to apply and the predictive accuracies of multi-variable equations
        are greater. Standard error of prediction for the one-variable equations ranges
        from about 34 to 45 percent and for the multi-variable equations ranges from
        about 31 to 42 percent.</p>\n<p>A region-of-influence regression method was
        also investigated for estimating flood-frequency discharges for ungaged stream
        sites in Iowa. A comparison of regional and region-of influence regression
        methods, based on ease of application and root mean square errors, determined
        the regional regression method to be the better estimation method for Iowa.</p>\n<p>Techniques
        for estimating flood-frequency discharges for streams in Iowa are presented
        for determining (1) regional regression estimates for ungaged sites on ungaged
        streams; (2) weighted estimates for gaged sites; and (3) weighted estimates
        for ungaged sites on gaged streams. The technique for determining regional
        regression estimates for ungaged sites on ungaged streams requires determining
        which of four possible examples applies to the location of the stream site
        and its basin. Illustrations for determining which example applies to an ungaged
        stream site and for applying both the one-variable and multi-variable regression
        equations are provided for the estimation techniques.</p>","language":"English","publisher":"U.S.

        in the Wapsipinicon and Cedar River Basins following two thunderstorms over
        northeast Iowa. During July 18-19, as much as 6 inches of rainfall was centered
        over Cerro Gordo, Floyd, Mitchell, and Worth Counties. During July 20-21,
        a second storm occurred in which an additional rainfall of as much as 8 inches
        was centered over Chickasaw and Floyd Counties. The cumulative effect of the
        storms produced floods with new maximum peak discharges at the following streamflow-gaging
        stations: Wapsipinicon River near Tripoli, 19,400 cubic feet per second; Cedar
        River at Charles City, 31,200 cubic feet per second (recurrence interval about
        90 years); Cedar River at Janesville, 42,200 cubic feet per second (recurrence
        interval about 80 years); and Flood Creek near Powersville, 19,000 cubic feet

        of remedial grouting on the ground-water flow system at Red Rock Dam near
        Pella, Iowa","docAbstract":"<p>Previous studies have shown direct evidence
        of under-seepage at Red Rock Dam on the Des Moines River near Pella, Iowa.
        Underseepage is thought to occur primarily on the northeast side of the dam
        in the lower bedrock of the St. Louis Limestone, which consists of discontinuous
        basal evaporite beds and an overlying cavity zone. Because of concerns about
        the integrity of the dam, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers initiated a remedial
        grouting program in September 1991. To assess the effectiveness of the remedial
        grouting program and to evaluate methods for future assessments, a study was
        conducted by the U.S. Geological Survey in cooperation with the U.S. Army
        Corps of Engineers.</p>\n<p>Potentiometric surface maps of the overburden
        and bedrock indicate that the direction of ground-water flow on the northeast
        side of the dam has changed little from pre-grout to post-grout periods. A
        comparison of water levels, between a pre-grout date and a post-grout date,
        shows that water levels decreased but that the decrease may be more attributable
        to changes in dam operations than to remedial grouting. Waterlevel data for
        the same two dates indicate that a more gradual potentiometric surface exists
        on the northeast side of the dam than on the southwest side of the dam, which
        suggests that the hydraulic connection between Lake Red Rock and downgradient
        bedrock wells still is greater on the northeast side of the dam than on the
        southwest side. Hydrographs for some wells on the northeast side of the dam
        indicated a departure from pre-grout trends at approximately the same time
        grouting was initiated. To varying degrees, hydrographs for the same wells
        then appear to return to a trend similar to pre-grout years, possibly as a
        result of new flow paths developing over time after remedial grouting. Spearman
        correlation coefficients computed for water levels in wells, pool, and tailwater
        indicate that some areas on the northeast side of the dam appear to be less
        under the influence of changing pool elevations after grouting than before
        grouting. This suggests that the hydraulic connection between the Red Rock
        pool and some downgradient areas has decreased.</p>\n<p>Analysis of water
        samples collected from selected wells on the northeast side of the dam shows
        significant increases in sulfate concentrations beginning about the same time
        remedial grouting was done upgradient from the wells, possibly indicating
        that flow paths were cut off to these wells, thereby reducing the amount of
        mixing with fresh reservoir water. Observable changes in chloride concentrations
        or trends as a result of remedial grouting were not apparent. Analysis results
        for hydrogen and oxygen stable isotope samples collected since 1995 indicate
        large seasonal fluctuations of isotope ratios in the tailwater (assumed representative
        of the reservoir). Similar but more subdued fluctuations were observed at
        some wells, but other wells appeared to have little seasonal change. Stable
        sulfur isotope results indicate the presence of distinct water types between
        Lake Red Rock and in ground water from downgradient bedrock wells. Sulfur
        isotope values from samples from a bedrock well located upgradient from the
        grout curtain indicate a mixture of pool and ground water, whereas samples
        from downgradient overburden wells have values similar to the pool. Samples
        from the bedrock wells downgradient from the grout curtain have sulfur isotope
        values similar to a value obtained from analysis of a gypsum and anhydrite
        core sample.</p>\n<p>Hydrographs, statistical analysis of waterlevel data,
        and water-chemistry data suggest that underseepage on the northeast side of
        the dam has been reduced but not completely eliminated. Some areas appear
        to have been affected to a greater degree and for a longer period of time
        than other areas. Future monitoring of water levels, water chemistry, and
        stable isotopes can aid in the evaluation of the long-term effectiveness of
        remedial grouting.</p>","language":"English","publisher":"U.S. Geological

        and distribution of pesticides in streams of the Eastern Iowa Basins, 1996-98","docAbstract":"<p>The
        U.S. Geological Survey began collection of water samples in streams of the
        Eastern Iowa Basins in 1996 for the analysis of pesticides and pesticide degradates
        as part of the National Water Quality Assessment Program (NAWQA). This study
        provides some of the first large scale monitoring data on pesticides and pesticide
        degradates in Eastern Iowa. Three hundred and forty-four samples were collected
        from 1996-98 to document the occurrence, distribution, and transport of pesticide
        compounds. Pesticide analysis included 80 pesticide compounds and 10 pesticide
        degradates. The Eastern Iowa Basins study encompasses about 50,500 square
        kilometers (19,500 square miles) and is drained by four major rivers--the
        Wapsipinicon, Cedar, Iowa, and Skunk. Agriculture accounts for approximately
        93 percent of the land use in the study area.</p>\n<p>The most commonly detected
        pesticides were those most heavily used on crops. The triazine (atrazine and
        cyanazine) and chloroacetanilide (alachlor, acetochlor, and metolachlor) pesticides
        are some of the most heavily used (by weight) historically and during the
        period of data collection 1996-98. Atrazine and metolachlor were detected
        in all samples. Acetochlor, alachlor, and cyanazine were detected in more
        than 70 percent of all surface-water samples. Few non-agricultural herbicides
        were detected. One exception, prometon was detected in more than 80 percent
        of the samples at very low concentrations (less than 0.1 micrograms per liter).</p>\n<p>Pesticide
        degradates were some of the most frequently detected pesticide compounds in
        the study. Four pesticide degradates--metolachlor ethane sulfonic acid (metolachlor
        ESA), alachlor ethane sulfonic acid (alachlor ESA), metolachlor oxanilic acid
        (metolachlor OA), and acetochlor ethane sulfonic acid (acetochlor ESA) were
        detected in more than 75 percent of the samples.</p>\n<p>A few insecticides
        that may pose potential risk to aquatic invertebrates were detected in streams
        from May through September, the months when most application normally occurs.
        Carbofuran was the most commonly detected insecticide (16 percent of all samples).
        Although detected in less than 20 percent of all samples, carbofuran was detected
        in 68 percent of the samples in June. When present, carbofuran concentrations
        were generally less than 0.80 micrograms per liter. Chloropyrifos was detected
        in about seven percent of the samples. As with other insecticides, chlorpyrifos
        was detected most frequently in June (30 percent). The highest concentration
        was 0.06 micrograms per liter. Diazinon, a common urban insecticide found
        in other NAWQA studies throughout the Nation, was detected in only 2 percent
        of the samples in the Eastern Iowa Basins study.</p>\n<p>Pesticides were found
        to occur in mixtures with several compounds rather than individually. Four
        or more parent pesticide compounds were detected in 91 percent of the water
        samples and seven or more parent compounds were detected in 46 percent of
        the water samples. Four or more pesticide degradates were detected in 93 percent
        of the water samples and seven or more pesticide degradates were detected
        in 46 percent of the water samples.</p>\n<p>Commonly applied parent pesticide
        compounds (acetochlor, alachlor, atrazine, cyanazine, and metolachlor) were
        generally detected at low concentrations with median concentrations ranging
        from 0.01 to 0.22 micrograms per liter. The median concentrations for the
        pesticide degradates were larger than their parent compounds. Median concentrations
        for the pesticide degradates ranged from 0.07 to 3.7 micrograms per liter.
        Acetochlor, alachlor, atrazine, cyanazine and metolachlor pesticides compounds
        were present at least an order of magnitude or higher in the late spring and
        summer than at other times of the year. The maximum measured concentrations
        for acetochlor, atrazine, cyanazine and metolachor were approximately 11 to
        48 micrograms per liter (the maximum for alachlor was 0.56 micrograms per
        liter). In contrast, maximum measured concentrations for the total pesticide
        degradates were lower than their parent compounds and ranged from approximately
        0.7 to 12 micrograms per liter. The maximum measured concentration of a single
        pesticide compound was for atrazine at 48 micrograms per liter.</p>\n<p>Seasonal
        patterns of atrazine, acetochlor, alachlor, cyanazine, and metolachlor generally
        show peak concentrations following application in May and June and decreasing
        during remainder of the growing season. In addition, a small secondary peak
        in atrazine, acetochlor, alachlor, cyanazine, and metolachlor concentrations
        occurred at all sites in late winter. This secondary peak may be attributed
        to early \"winter thaw\" that can release pesticide residue from soil, making
        pesticides available to be transported to surface water by snowmelt and early
        spring rains.</p>\n<p>Pesticide degradates account for a significant portion
        of the total pesticide load at all sites. Eighty-one percent of the total
        pesticide load in samples from Iowa River near Rowan, Wolf Creek near Dysart,
        and the Iowa River at Wapello were as pesticide degradates. The pesticide
        degradates for the triazine compounds tended to follow the load pattern of
        the parent pesticide compounds closely throughout the year. In general, the
        degradate loads calculated for the triazine compounds were smaller than loads
        calculated for their parent pesticides. The loads for the chloroacetanilide
        degradate compounds were larger than those for the parent pesticides. The
        loads for alachlor were found to be small or nonexistent. Alachlor has been
        heavily used in the past, but since 1995 has been largely replaced by acetochlor
        or other herbicides. The loads for all degradates were higher than the parent
        compounds during the winter months. Overland flow may be diminished during
        the winter months, but shallow sub-soil drainage and ground-water flow may
        be a source of many pesticide degradates during the late fall and winter.</p>\n<p>Occurrence
        of pesticide compounds varied by landform region. The triazine herbicides,
        atrazine and cyanazine and their degradates were present in significantly
        greater concentrations in the Southern Iowa Drift Plain (predominantly loess
        soils) than either the Des Moines Lobe or the Iowan Surface (predominantly
        till soils). Less atrazine and cyanazine are applied to till soils because
        of pH and organic carbon content. Alachlor, metolachlor, and acetochlor have
        often been used to offset triazine pesticide reductions in area with till
        soils.</p>","largerWorkType":{"id":4,"text":"Book"},"largerWorkTitle":"Proceedings

        of water in alluvial aquifers in eastern Iowa","docAbstract":"<p>The goal
        of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) National Water-Quality Assessment (NAWQA)
        Program is to assess the status and trends in the quality of the Nation''s
        surface and ground water, and to better understand the natural and human factors
        affecting water quality. The Eastern Iowa Basins study unit encompasses an
        area of about 50,500 square kilometers (19,500 square miles) in eastern Iowa
        and southern Minnesota and is one of 59 study units in the NAWQA program.
        Land-use studies are an important component of the NAWQA program, and are
        designed to assess the concentration and distribution of water-quality constituents
        in recently recharged ground water associated with the most significant land
        use and hydrogeologic settings within a study unit. The focus of the land-use
        study in the Eastern Iowa Basins study unit is agricultural and urban land
        uses and alluvial aquifers. Agriculture is the dominant land use in the study
        unit. Urban areas, although not extensive, represent important potential source
        areas of contaminants associated with residential, commercial, and industrial
        activities. Alluvial aquifers are present throughout much of the study unit,
        and constitute a major ground-water supply that is susceptible to contamination
        from land-use activities.</p>\n<p>Ground-water samples were collected from
        monitoring wells at 31 agricultural and 30 urban sites in the Eastern Iowa
        Basins study unit during June-August 1997 to evaluate the effects of land
        use and hydrogeology on the water quality of alluvial aquifers. Calcium, magnesium,
        and bicarbonate were the dominant ions in most samples and were likely derived
        from solution of carbonate minerals (calcite and dolomite) present in alluvial
        detrital deposits. Tritium-based ages indicate ground water was most likely
        recharged after the 1950''s at all but one sampling site. Agricultural and
        urban land-use areas have remained relatively stable in the study area since
        the 1950''s, therefore the effects of current land use should be reflected
        in ground water sampled during this study. Sodium and chloride concentrations
        were significantly higher in samples from urban areas, where roads are more
        numerous and road salts may be more frequently applied, than in agricultural
        areas. Nitrate was detected in 94 percent of samples from agricultural areas
        and 77 percent of samples from urban areas. Nitrate concentrations were significantly
        higher in agricultural areas than in urban areas and exceeded the U.S. Environmental
        Protection Agency maximum contaminant level for drinking water (10 milligrams
        per liter as N) in 39 percent of samples from agricultural areas. Nitrate
        concentrations in samples from urban areas did not exceed the maximum contaminant
        level. Greater usage of fertilizers in agricultural areas most likely contributes
        to higher nitrate concentrations in samples from those areas.</p>\n<p>Pesticides
        were detected in 84 percent of samples from agricultural areas and 70 percent
        from urban areas. Atrazine and metolachlor were the most frequently detected
        pesticides in samples from agricultural areas; atrazine and prometon were
        the most frequently detected pesticides in samples from urban areas. None
        of the pesticide concentrations exceeded U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
        maximum contaminant levels or lifetime health advisories for drinking water.
        Pesticide degradates were detected in 94 percent of samples from agricultural
        areas and 53 percent from urban areas. Metolachlor ethane sulfonic acid and
        deethylatrazine were the most frequently detected metabolites in samples from
        agricultural areas; metolachlor ethane sulfonic acid and alachlor ethane sulfonic
        acid were the most frequently detected degradates in samples from urban areas.
        Total degradate concentrations were significantly higher in samples from agricultural
        areas than in samples from urban areas. Total pesticide concentrations (parent
        compounds) tended to be higher in samples from agricultural areas; however,
        this difference was not statistically significant. Degradates constituted
        the major portion of the total residue concentration in the alluvial aquifer.</p>\n<p>Volatile
        organic compounds were detected in 40 percent of samples from urban areas
        and 10 percent from agricultural areas. Methyl tert-butyl ether was the most
        commonly detected volatile organic compound and was present in 23 percent
        of samples from urban areas. Elevated concentrations (greater than 30 micrograms
        per liter) of methyl tert-butyl ether and BTEX compounds (benzene, toluene,
        ethylbenzene, and xylene) in two samples from urban areas suggest the possible
        presence of point-source gasoline leaks or spills.</p>\n<p>Factors other than
        land use may contribute to observed differences in water quality between and
        within agricultural and urban areas. Nitrate, atrazine, deethylatrazine, and
        deisopropylatrazine concentrations were significantly higher in shallow wells
        with sample intervals nearer the water table and in wells with thinner cumulative
        clay thickness above the sample intervals, suggesting that longer flow paths
        allow for greater residence time and increase opportunities for sorbtion,
        degradation, and dispersion which may contribute to decreases in nutrient
        and pesticide concentrations with depth. Nitrogen speciation was influenced
        by redox conditions. Nitrate concentrations were significantly higher in ground
        water with dissolved-oxygen concentrations in excess of 0.5 milligrams per
        liter. Ammonia concentrations were higher in ground water with dissolved-oxygen
        concentrations of 0.5 milligrams per liter or less, however, this relation
        was not statistically significant. The amount of available organic matter
        may limit denitrification rates. Elevated nitrate concentrations (greater
        than 2.0 mg/L) were significantly related to lower dissolved organic carbon
        concentrations in water samples from both agricultural and urban areas. A
        similar relation between nitrate concentrations (in water) and organic carbon
        concentrations (in aquifer material) also was observed but was not statistically
        significant.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","largerWorkType":{"id":4,"text":"Book"},"largerWorkTitle":"Proceedings

        article summarizes major findings about nutrients in surface and groundwater
        in the eastern Iowa basins (see map) between 1996 and 1998. The data were
        collected as part of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) National Water-Quality
        Assessment Program (NAWQA). Water quality is discussed in terms of local and
        regional issues and compared with conditions found in all 36 National NAWQA
        study areas assessed to date. Findings are explained in the context of selected
        national U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) benchmarks, such as those
        for drinking water quality and the protection of aquatic organisms.</p>\n<p>The
        Eastern Iowa Basins Study Unit includes the Wapsipinicon, Cedar, Iowa, and
        Skunk River basins and covers approximately 19,500 square miles in eastern
        Iowa and southern Minnesota. More than 90 percent of the land in the study
        unit is used for agricultural purposes. Forested areas account for only 4
        percent of the land area.</p>","largerWorkType":{"id":2,"text":"Article"},"largerWorkTitle":"Integrated

        a computer program to quantify drainage basin characteristics","docAbstract":"<p>Surface
        water runoff is a function of many interrelated factors including climate,
        soils, landuse, and the physiography of the drainage basin. A practical and
        effective method to quantify drainage basin characteristics would allow analysis
        of the interrelations of these factors, leading to an improved understanding
        of the effects of drainage basin characteristics on surface-water runoff.
        Historically, the quantification of drainage basin characteristics has been
        a tedious and time-consuming process. Recent improvements in computer hardware
        and software technology have enabled the developers of a program called Basinsoft
        to automate this process. Basinsoft requires minimal preprocessing of data
        and provides an efficient, automated procedure for quantifying selected morphometric
        characteristics and the option to area-weight characteristics for a drainage
        basin. The user of Basinsoft is assumed to have a limited amount of experience
        in the use of ARC/INFO, a proprietary geographic information system (GIS).
        (The use of brand names in this chapter is for identification purposes only
        and does not constitute endorsement by the U.S. Geological Survey [USGS].)</p>\n<p>In
        1988, the USGS began developing a program called Basinsoft. The initial program
        quantified 16 selected drainage basin characteristics from three source-data
        layers that were manually digitized from topographic maps using the versions
        of ARC/INFO, Fortran programs, and prime system Command Programming Language
        (CPL) programs available in 1988 (Majure and Soenksen, 1991). By 1991, Basinsoft
        was enhanced to quantify 27 selected drainage-basin characteristics from three
        source-data layers automatically generated from digital elevation model (DEM)
        data using a set of Fortran programs (Majure and Eash, 1991: Jenson and Dominique,
        1988). Due to edge-matching problems encountered in 1991 with the preprocessing</p>","largerWorkType":{"id":4,"text":"Book"},"largerWorkTitle":"GIS

        examined to determine the effect of soil on the transport of agrichemicals
        to groundwater. This paper examines the relation of soil characteristics to
        concentrations and occurrence nitrate, atrazine, and atrazine residue from
        99 wells completed in unconsolidated aquifers across the Midwestern United
        States. Soil characteristics that determine the rate of water movement were
        directly related to the occurrence and concentrations of nitrate and atrazine
        in groundwater. The substantial differences in the relations found among soil
        characteristics and nitrate and atrazine in groundwater suggest that different
        processes affect the transformation, adsorption, and transport of these contaminants.
        A multi-variable analysis determined that the soil characteristics examined
        explained the amount of variability in concentrations for nitrate (19%), atrazine
        (33%), and atrazine residue (29%). These results document that, although soils
        do affect the transport of agrichemicals to groundwater, other factors such
        as hydrology, land use, and climate must also be considered to understand
        the occurrence of agrichemicals in groundwater.</p>","largerWorkType":{"id":2,"text":"Article"},"largerWorkTitle":"Water

        streams in the Wapsipinicon, Cedar, Iowa, and Skunk River basins in eastern
        Iowa were sampled monthly from March 1996 through September 1998 to assess
        the occurrence, distribution, and transport of nitrogen, phosphorus, and suspended
        sediment as part of the U.S. Geological Survey''s National Water-Quality Assessment
        Program. At least one form of dissolved nitrogen and phosphorus was detected
        in every sample collected. Nitrate accounted for 92 percent of the dissolved
        nitrogen. About 22 percent of the samples contained nitrate that exceeded
        the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency''s Maximum Contaminant Level of 10
        milligrams per liter (mg/L) as nitrogen in drinking water. The median concentration
        of total nitrogen for surface water in the study area was 7.2 mg/L. Dissolved
        phosphorus was predominately in the form of orthophosphate. The median total
        phosphorus concentration for the study area was 0.22 mg/L. About 75 percent
        of the total phosphorus concentrations exceeded the U.S. Environmental Protection
        Agency recommended total phosphorus concentration of 0.10 mg/L or less to
        minimize algal growth in streams not discharging directly into lakes or impoundments.
        Median suspended-sediment concentration for the study area was 82 mg/L.</p>\n<p>Nitrogen,
        phosphorus, and suspended-sediment concentrations varied annually and seasonally.
        Nitrogen, phosphorus, and suspended-sediment concentrations increased each
        year of the study due to increased precipitation and runoff. Concentrations
        were typically higher in the spring after fertilizer application and runoff.
        In winter, nitrogen concentrations typically increased when there was little
        instream assimilation by aquatic plants and algae. Nitrogen and phosphorus
        concentrations decreased in late summer when there was less runoff and instream
        assimilation of nitrogen and phosphorus by aquatic plants and algae was high.
        Suspended-sediment concentrations were highest in early summer during runoff
        and lowest in January when there was ice cover with very little overland flow
        contributing to rivers and streams.</p>\n<p>Streams draining small- to medium-sized
        watersheds that have uniform land use and geology had significantly (p &lt;
        0.05) higher total dissolved-nitrogen concentrations (median, 8.2 mg/L) than
        did samples from large rivers (median, 6.2 mg/L) that drain basins with mixed
        land use and geology. Samples from large rivers typically had significantly
        (p&lt; 0.05) higher total phosphorus and suspended-sediment concentrations
        than did samples from small rivers and streams.</p>\n<p>Concentrations varied
        between drainage basins due to land use and physiography. Basins that are
        located in areas with a higher percentage of row-crop agriculture typically
        had samples with higher nitrogen concentrations than did basins with less
        row-crop agriculture. In addition, basins that drain the Southern Iowa Drift
        Plain and the Des Moines Lobe typically had samples with higher total phosphorus
        and suspended-sediment concentrations than did basins that drain other landform
        regions.</p>\n<p>Total nitrogen and total phosphorus loads were typically
        proportional to the size of the drainage basin. Total nitrogen loads increased
        each year from 1996 through 1998 in conjunction with increased concentrations
        and runoff. However, total phosphorus loads in the Skunk River Basin decreased
        in 1997 due to less runoff. Total phosphorus loads followed the same pattern
        as total nitrogen loads with increases in 1998. Total nitrogen and total phosphorus
        loads varied seasonally and the highest loads typically occurred in early
        spring and summer after fertilizer application and runoff. Loads were lowest
        in January and September when there was little runoff to transport nitrogen
        and phosphorus to the rivers and streams.</p>\n<p>Total nitrogen loads contributed
        to the Mississippi River from the Eastern Iowa Basins during 1996, 1997, and
        1998 were 97,000, 120,000, and 230,000 metric tons respectively. Total phosphorus
        loads contributed to the Mississippi River from the Eastern Iowa Basins during
        1996, 1997, and 1998 were 6,900, 4,600, and 8,800 metric tons, respectively.
        The highest nitrogen and phosphorus yields typically occurred in streams draining
        small watersheds that were dominated by a single land use and geology. Sampling
        sites located in drainage basins with higher row-crop percentage typically
        had higher nitrogen and phosphorus yields. Sites that were located in the
        Des Moines Lobe and the Southern Iowa Drift Plain typically had higher phosphorus
        yields probably due to more erodible soils and steeper slopes.</p>","largerWorkType":{"id":4,"text":"Book"},"largerWorkTitle":"Proceedings

        quality assessment of the Eastern Iowa Basins: Basic water chemistry of rivers
        and streams, 1996-98","docAbstract":"<p>The U.S. Geological Survey began data-collection
        activities in the Eastern Iowa Basins study unit of the National Water-Quality
        Assessment Program in September 1995 with the purpose of determining the status
        and trends in water quality of water from the Wapsipinicon, Cedar, Iowa, and
        Skunk River basins. From March 1996 through September 1998, monthly surface-water
        samples were collected from 11 sites on the study''s rivers and streams representing
        three distinct physiographic regions, the Des Moines Lobe, the Iowan Surface,
        the Southern Iowa Drift Plain, and one subregion, the Iowan Karst. These water
        samples were analyzed for basic water chemistry, including, but not limited
        to the following cations: sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium, and silica;
        anions: chloride, fluoride, sulfate, and bicarbonate; and two metals - iron
        and maganese. Although none of the concentrations of the constituents exceeded
        health advisories or drinking-water regulations, extremely high or low concentrations
        could potentially affect aquatic life. Calcium, magnesium, and potassium are
        essential elements for both plant and animal life; manganese is an essential
        element in plant metabolism; and silica is important in the growth of diatom
        algae. Calcium had the largest median concentration of 61 milligrams per liter
        (mg/L) of the cations, and the largest maximum concentration of 100 mg/L.
        Bicarbonate had the largest median concentration of 210 mg/L of the anions,
        and the largest maximum concentration of 400 mg/L.</p>\n<p>Basic water-quality
        differences related to physiographic differences and seasonality were evident
        in streams and rivers in the Eastern Iowa Basins. Of the three major landforms,
        water samples from sites within the Des Moines Lobe, the youngest landform
        in the study area, had significantly higher median concentrations of calcium
        (85 mg/L), magnesium (28 mg/L), sulfate (28 mg/L), fluoride (0.31 mg/L), and
        silica (16 mg/L). The Des Moines Lobe region is calcium magnesium bicarbonate-rich
        due to the Paleozoic source rocks (limestones and shales) in the bedrock.
        Water samples from sites within the Southern Iowa Drift Plain had higher median
        concentrations of sodium (12 mg/L), potassium (3.2 mg/L), and chloride (21
        mg/L). Concentrations also varied according to the time of year. Grouping
        the data into four seasonal periods, water samples collected during the months
        of October, November, and December, had higher median concentrations of calcium,
        magnesium, and chloride, then samples collected during other quarters of the
        year. Water quality in the streams during this low-flow period (October through
        December) is representative of that in the contributing aquifers.</p>","largerWorkType":{"id":4,"text":"Book"},"largerWorkTitle":"Proceedings

        parent compound","docAbstract":"<p>A recently developed analytical method
        using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry was used to investigate the
        occurrence of cyanazine and its degradates cyanazine acid (CAC), cyanazine
        amide (CAM), deethylcyanazine (DEC), and deethylcyanazine acid (DCAC) in groundwater.
        This research represents some of the earliest data on the occurrence of cyanazine
        degradates in groundwater. Although cyanazine was infrequently detected in
        the 64 wells across Iowa sampled in 1999, cyanazine degradates were commonly
        found during this study. The most frequently detected cyanazine compound was
        DCAC (32.8%) followed by CAC (29.7%), CAM (17.2%), DEC (3.1%), and cyanazine
        (3.1%). The frequency of detection for cyanazine or one or more of its degradates
        (CYTOT) was more than 12-fold over that of cyanazine alone (39.1% for CYTOT
        versus 3.1% for cyanazine). Of the total measured concentration of cyanazine,
        only 0.2% was derived from its parent compound - with DCAC (74.1%) and CAC
        (18.4%) comprising 92.5% of this total. Thus, although DCAC and CAC had similar
        frequencies of detection, DCAC was generally present in higher concentrations.
        No concentrations of cyanazine compounds for this study exceeded water-quality
        criteria for the protection of human health. Only cyanazine, however, has
        such a criteria established. Nevertheless, because these cyanazine degradates
        are still chlorinated, they may have similar toxicity as their parent compound
        - similar to what has been found with the chlorinated degradates of atrazine.
        Thus, the results of this study documented that data on the degradates for
        cyanazine are critical for understanding its fate and transport in the hydrologic
        system. Furthermore, the prevalence of the chlorinated degradates of cyanazine
        found in groundwater suggests that to accurately determine the overall effect
        on human health and the environment from cyanazine its degradates should also
        be considered. In addition, because CYTOT was found in 57.6% of the samples
        collected from alluvial aquifers, about 2-5 times more frequently than the
        other major aquifer types (glacial drift, bedrock/karst, bedrock/nonkarst)
        under investigation, this finding has long-term implications for the occurrence
        of CYTOT in streams. It is anticipated that low-level concentrations of CYTOT
        will continue to be detected in streams for years after the use of cyanazine
        has terminated (scheduled for the year 2000 in the United States), primarily
        through its movement from groundwater into streams during base-flow conditions.</p>","largerWorkType":{"id":2,"text":"Article"},"largerWorkTitle":"Environmental

        Iowa consists of records of stage, discharge, and water quality of streams;
        stage and contents of lakes and reservoirs; and water levels and water quality
        of ground water. This report, in two volumes, contains stage or discharge
        records for 126 gaging stations; stage or contents records for 9 lakes and
        reservoirs; water-quality records for 4 gaging stations; sediment records
        for 12 gaging stations; and water levels for 167 ground-water observation
        wells. Also included are peak-flow data for 93 crest-stage partial-record
        stations, water-quality data from 45 municipal wells, and precipitation data
        collected at 6 gaging stations and 2 precipitation sites. Additional water
        data were collected at various sites not included in the systematic data-collection
        program, and are published here as miscellaneous measurements and analyses.
        These data represent that part of the National Water Data System operated

        flowing through cropland in the Midwestern Corn Belt differ considerably in
        their chemical and ecological characteristics, even though agricultural land
        use is highly intensive throughout the entire region. These differences likely
        are attributable to differences in riparian vegetation, soil properties, and
        hydrology. This conclusion is based on results from a study of the upper Midwest
        region conducted during seasonally low-flow conditions in August 1997 by the
        U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) National Water Quality Assessment (NAWQA) Program.
        This report summarizes significant results from the study and presents some
        implications for the design and interpretation of water-quality monitoring
        and assessment studies based on these results.</p>","language":"English","publisher":"U.S.

        ground-water flow and water quality of the Mississippi River alluvium near
        Burlington, Iowa, 1999","docAbstract":"<p>The City of Burlington, Iowa, obtains
        some of its public water supply by withdrawing ground water from the Mississippi
        River alluvium, an alluvial aquifer adjacent to the Mississippi River. The
        U.S. Geological Survey, in cooperation with the City of Burlington, conducted
        a hydrologic study of the Mississippi River alluvium near Burlington in 1999
        to improve understanding of the flow system, evaluate the effects of hypothetical
        pumping scenarios on the flow system, and evaluate selected water-quality
        constituents in parts of the alluvium.</p>\n<p>A steady-state, ground-water
        flow model was constructed for a 7-square-mile area of the alluvium using
        October 1999 hydrologic conditions to help conceptualize the flow system,
        identify sources of water to the alluvium, and assess potential effects from
        additional hypothetical ground-water withdrawals from the lower alluvium.
        The model was discretized into a 70-row by 68-column grid using cells measuring
        200 feet by 200 feet. Three model layers were used to represent flow in the
        upper part of the alluvium, lower part of the alluvium, and bedrock. The primary
        sources of ground water to the alluvium were subsurface flow from areas of
        the alluvium adjacent to the modeled area, recharge from precipitation, subsurface
        flow from Flint River streamchannel deposits adjacent to the alluvium, and
        river leakage. The primary components of outflow from the flow system were
        river leakage, municipal ground-water withdrawals (pumpage), and leakage to
        drainage ditches.</p>\n<p>Three hypothetical pumping scenarios were used to
        assess the potential effects of increased ground-water withdrawals from the
        lower part of the alluvium: (1) pumping a second existing municipal well at
        a rate of 0.5 million gallons per day, (2) pumping a hypothetical well completed
        in an area between the city water-treatment facility and Flint River at a
        rate of 1.0 million gallons per day, and (3) pumping a hypothetical well completed
        in an area south of the Flint River at a rate of 1.0 million gallons per day.
        Maximum additional simulated drawdown in the upper alluvium ranged from less
        than 3 feet (for scenario 1) to about 9 feet (for scenario 3). Maximum additional
        simulated drawdown in the lower alluvium ranged from about 12 feet (for scenario
        1) to about 34 feet (for scenario 3). Water budgets for each scenario indicated
        future additional withdrawals from the flow system near Burlington&rsquo;s
        existing municipal wells would significantly increase the amount of river
        leakage into the flow system.</p>\n<p>Water samples collected from the alluvium
        indicated ground water can be classified as a calcium-magnesium-bicarbonate
        type. Reducing conditions likely occur in some localized areas of the alluvium,
        as suggested by relatively large concentrations of dissolved iron (4,390 micrograms
        per liter) and manganese (2, 430 micrograms per liter) in some ground-water
        samples. Nitrite plus nitrate was detected at concentrations greater than
        or equal to 8 milligrams per liter in three samples collected from observation
        wells completed in close proximity to cropland; the nitrite plus nitrate concentration
        in one groundwater sample exceeded the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
        Maximum Contaminant Level for nitrate in drinking water (10 milligrams per
        liter as N). Triazine herbicides (atrazine, cyanazine, propazine, simazine,
        and selected degradation products) and chloroacetanilide herbicides (acetochlor,
        alachlor, and metolachlor) were detected in some water samples. A greater
        number of herbicide compounds were detected in surface-water samples than
        in ground-water samples. Herbicide concentrations typically were at least
        an order of magnitude greater in surfacewater samples than in ground-water
        samples. The Maximum Contaminant Level for alachlor (2 micrograms per liter)
        was exceeded in a sample from Dry Branch Creek at Tama Road and for atrazine
        (3 micrograms per liter) was exceeded in samples collected from Dry Branch
        Creek at Tama Road and the county drainage ditch at Tama Road.</p>","language":"English","publisher":"U.S.

        U.S. Geological Survey, in cooperation with the City of Fort Madison, conducted
        a study of the potential sources and possible processes that might produce
        ammonia in ground water from the Mississippi River alluvium near Fort Madison,
        Iowa. High ammonia concentrations of 3.0 to 6.4 milligrams per liter were
        detected in water produced from municipal well Fort Madison #4 from 1992 through
        1996. Total organic carbon concentrations of about 5 milligrams per liter
        were also reported during the same time period.</p>\n<p>Water-level measurements
        from two municipal wells and one well at Iowa State Penitentiary were used
        to determine that the general direction of ground-water flow during the two
        days of sampling was from northeast to southwest toward wells Fort Madison
        #4 and Fort Madison #5. Continuous pumping of other nearby wells probably
        influenced the direction of ground-water flow on these days. Because of a
        till confining unit separating the Mississippi River and the alluvial aquifer,
        it is uncertain to what extent induced recharge occurs to the alluvial aquifer
        from the river.</p>\n<p>Water samples were collected from three municipal
        wells, two industrial wells, one watersupply well at the Iowa State Penitentiary,
        one domestic well, two creeks, and the Mississippi River. Tritium analytical
        results indicate that the time of recharge was after 1953 for water from the
        municipal wells (where tritium samples were collected). The ammonia concentration,
        5.1 milligrams per liter, was considerably higher in ground water collected
        from well Fort Madison #4 compared to samples collected from other wells.
        The dissolved organic carbon concentration was also highest in ground water
        collected from well Fort Madison #4 (5.5 milligrams per liter) although samples
        from other wells were also relatively high, 2.6 to 5.3 milligrams per liter.
        The most likely process producing the high ammonia concentration in ground
        water in the vicinity of well Fort Madison #4 is decomposition of organic
        matter (ammonification). Nitrogen isotope values, when compared to nitrogen
        isotope values found in ground water in the vicinity of some of the other
        wells, indicate the possibility that a higher percentage of the ammonia found
        in ground water in the vicinity of well Fort Madison #4 may be from human
        and(or) other animal wastes. Higher concentrations of dissolved phosphorus,
        orthophosphate, and a higher chloride-to-sodium mole ratio found in ground
        water sampled from well Fort Madison #4 could be indicative of a sewage or
        septic source. Potential sources include existing or abandoned septic systems,
        leaking sanitary sewer lines, commercial or residential waste-disposal sites,
        and agricultural runoff upgradient from well Fort Madison #4, or possibly,
        bed sediments of the Mississippi River.</p>","language":"English","publisher":"U.S.

        benthic invertebrate taxa were identified from snags and woody debris in streams
        and rivers of the Wapsipinicon, Cedar, Iowa, and Skunk River Basins in the
        Eastern Iowa Basins (EIWA) study unit of the U.S. Geological Survey National
        Water-Quality Assessment Program. The composition, distribution, and abundance
        of 74 predominant taxa were related to environmental conditions in the study
        unit, using habitat, hydrologic, and water-quality data. Four groups of sites
        were defined, based on the distribution and relative abundance of taxa. Detrended
        correspondence analysis was used to identify relations in the structure of
        the invertebrate assemblages, and the correspondence of taxa and sites in
        the groups was related to habitat, hydrologic, and water-quality information.
        Responses of invertebrate assemblages were explained by natural factors, such
        as surficial geology or physical habitat conditions, as well as human influences,
        such as agriculture or high-density hog-feeding operations.</p>\n<p>Mayflies,
        caddisflies, and true flies were well represented in streams and rivers of
        the EIWA study unit. The mayflies <i>Tricorythodes</i> and <i>Baetis intercalaris</i>,
        the net-spinning caddisflies <i>Hydropsyche bidens</i> and H. simulans, and
        the Chironomidae <i>Glyptotendipes</i>, <i>Polypedilum</i>, and <i>Rheotanytarsus</i>
        predominated. Spatial variation in benthic invertebrate assemblages within
        a site was less than that observed among sites. Assemblages from 3 years of
        sampling generally were grouped by site, with exceptions related to differences
        in discharge among years.</p>\n<p>The benthic invertebrate assemblages associated
        with the four groups of sites reflected the cumulative effects of agricultural
        and urban land use, sources of nutrient and organic enrichment, and longitudinal
        stream succession&mdash;the natural sequence of communities in streams from
        headwaters to large rivers. These factors, especially the natural changes
        from upstream to downstream, were influential in characterizing the benthic
        invertebrate assemblages of the site groups.</p>\n<p>Stream size, a reflection
        of basin area, was a principal influence in categorizing the benthic invertebrate
        assemblages, with sites that have the largest basin areas forming a separate
        group. Although it is difficult to distinguish among the contributions of
        large basin area, increased concentrations of nutrients and pesticides, and
        decreasing instream habitat diversity, the resulting invertebrate assemblage
        described was distinct. The remaining sites were headwater or tributary streams
        that reflected conditions more common to smaller streams, such as higher gradients
        and the potential for more diverse or extensive riparian habitat, but were
        distinguished by landform. Following basin area in importance, landform contributed
        to the differences observed among the benthic invertebrate communities at
        the remaining sites.</p>","language":"English","publisher":"U.S. Geological

        quality of shallow alluvial ground water that is used for domestic supplies
        in the Wapsipinicon, Cedar, Iowa, and Skunk River Basins (Eastern Iowa Basins)
        is described. Water samples from 32 domestic-supply wells were collected from
        June through July 1998. This study of ground-water quality in alluvial aquifers
        in the Eastern Iowa Basins is part of the U.S. Geological Survey''s National
        Water-Quality Assessment Program.</p>\n<p>Calcium and bicarbonate were the
        dominant ions in solution, likely derived from the dissolution of carbonate
        minerals in the alluvial aquifer material. Concentrations of iron exceeded
        the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Secondary Maximum Contaminant Level
        (300 micrograms per liter) for drinking water in 53 percent of the samples,
        and 50 percent of the samples exceeded the Secondary Maximum Contaminant Level
        for manganese (50 micrograms per liter). pH and alkalinity increased and sulfate
        concentrations decreased with increasing well depth.</p>\n<p>Nitrite plus
        nitrate nitrogen was detected in 53 percent of the samples and exceeded the
        U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Maximum Contaminant Level of 10 milligrams
        per liter for drinking water in 13 percent of the samples. Nitrite plus nitrate
        nitrogen concentrations were negatively correlated with well depth and positively
        correlated with percentage of oxygen saturation. Ammonia plus organic nitrogen
        concentrations were positively correlated with well depth, and ratios of nitrite
        plus nitrate to ammonia were positively correlated with percentage of oxygen
        saturation.</p>\n<p>The majority of samples, 72 percent, contained water recharged
        since the early 1950''s. The recharge date of water was earlier in deeper
        wells. Nitrite plus nitrate and total pesticide concentrations were greater
        in more recently recharged water.</p>\n<p>Eight pesticides and eight pesticide
        metabolites were detected in ground-water samples. Atrazine was the most commonly
        detected pesticide, and metolachlor ethanesulfonic acid was the most commonly
        detected metabolite. No pesticide detections exceeded U.S. Environmental Protection
        Agency drinking-water Maximum Contaminant Levels.</p>\n<p>The effects of land
        use on ground-water quality also were examined. There was a positive correlation
        between percentage of land used for soybean production and concentrations
        of metolachlor, metolachlor ethanesulfonic acid, and metolachlor oxanilic
        acid in ground-water samples.<br />Data from this study and from previous
        studies in the Eastern Iowa Basins were compared statistically by well type
        (domestic, municipal, and monitoring wells). Well depths were significantly
        greater in domestic and municipal wells than in monitoring wells. pH, calcium,
        sulfate, chloride, and atrazine concentrations were significantly higher in
        municipal-well samples than in domestic-well samples. pH and sulfate concentrations
        were significantly higher in municipal-well samples than in monitoring-well
        samples. Ammonia was significantly higher in domestic-well samples than in
        monitoring-well samples, chloride was significantly higher in monitoring-well
        samples than in domestic-well samples, and fluoride was significantly higher
        in domestic-well samples than in municipal-well samples.</p>","language":"English","publisher":"U.S.

        and water-quality aspects of a 500-year flood - Nishnabotna River, southwest
        Iowa, June 1998","docAbstract":"<p>Flooding that occurred in southwest Iowa
        during June 15&ndash;17, 1998, was the worst flood ever recorded on the Nishnabotna
        River, exceeding the theoretical 500-year flood calculated from peak-flow
        records (1922 to present). This flood was a direct consequence of severe thunderstorm
        activity that caused more than 4 inches of rain to fall over a large part
        of the Nishnabotna River Basin. In fact, a new official State record for 24-hour
        total rainfall (13.18 inches) was set by this storm. The peak streamflow of
        the Nishnabotna River near Hamburg, Iowa, was 65,100 cubic feet per second,
        about 20 percent more than any previous recorded peak streamflow at this site.</p>\n<p>To
        determine the concentrations of selected contaminants that might be present
        in this record flooding, water-quality samples were collected within hours
        of the flood peak. The results from these samples documented the presence
        of numerous herbicide compounds (11 parent compounds and 12 herbicide degradates).
        The highest herbicide concentration was 5.06 micrograms per liter (&micro;g/L)
        for atrazine, followed by metolachlor (1.16 &micro;g/L), metolachlor ESA (1.04
        &micro;g/L), acetochlor OA (0.99 &micro;g/L), and acetochlor ESA (0.95 &micro;g/L).
        The total herbicide concentration (summation of the 23 herbicide compounds
        detected) was 15.6 &micro;g/L. The timing of the severe thunderstorm activity
        and flooding, which occurred shortly after chemical application associated
        with planting of crops, was the principal reason for the large number and
        concentrations of herbicide compounds found in the flood water.</p>\n<p>At
        the time the water-quality samples were collected, the Nishnabotna River was
        transporting about 6,000 pounds of suspended sediment, 18 pounds of nitrogen,
        3 pounds of phosphorus, and 0.02 pound of atrazine each second. These loads
        were about 10 to 150 times greater than those during a previous runoff event,
        and about 260 to 4,600 times greater than those during a previous base-flow
        condition.</p>\n<p>This sampling demonstrates the importance of collecting
        both water-quantity and water-quality data during flood events to estimate
        contaminant loads. Potential environmental effects of a flood can only be
        understood when both components are measured.</p>","language":"English","publisher":"U.S.

        of land use and hydrogeology on the water quality of alluvial aquifers in
        eastern Iowa and southern Minnesota, 1997","docAbstract":"<p>Ground-water
        samples were collected from monitoring wells at 31 agricultural and 30 urban
        sites in the Eastern Iowa Basins study unit during June&ndash;August 1997
        to evaluate the effects of land use and hydrogeology on the water quality
        of alluvial aquifers. Ground-water samples were analyzed for common ions,
        nutrients, dissolved organic carbon, tritium, radon-222, pesticides and pesticide
        metabolites, volatile organic compounds, and environmental isotopes.</p>\n<p>Calcium,
        magnesium, and bicarbonate were the dominant ions in most samples and were
        likely derived from solution of carbonate minerals (calcite and dolomite)
        present in alluvial detrital deposits. Chloride and nitrate were dominant
        anions in samples from several wells. Sodium and chloride concentrations were
        significantly higher in samples from urban areas, where roads are more numerous
        and road salts may be more frequently applied, than in agricultural areas.
        Nitrate was detected in 94 percent of samples from agricultural areas and
        77 percent of samples from urban areas. Nitrate concentrations were significantly
        higher in agricultural areas than in urban areas and exceeded the U.S. Environmental
        Protection Agency maximum ontaminant level for drinking water (10 milligrams
        per liter as N) in 39 percent of samples from agricultural areas. Nitrate
        concentrations in samples from urban areas did not exceed the maximum contaminant
        level. Greater use of fertilizers in agricultural areas most likely contributes
        to higher nitrate concentrations in samples from those areas.</p>\n<p>Tritium-based
        ages indicate ground water was most likely recharged after the 1950&rsquo;s
        at all but one sampling site. Agricultural and urban land-use areas have remained
        relatively stable in the study area since the 1950&rsquo;s; therefore, the
        effects of current land use should be reflected in ground water sampled during
        this study. Radon-222 was detected in all samples and exceeded the U.S. Environmental
        Protection Agency&rsquo;s previously proposed maximum contaminant level for
        drinking water (300 picocuries per liter) in 71 percent of samples.</p>\n<p>Pesticides
        were detected in 84 percent of samples from agricultural areas and 70 percent
        from urban areas. Atrazine and metolachlor were the most frequently detected
        pesticides in samples from agricultural areas; atrazine and prometon were
        the most frequently detected pesticides in samples from urban areas. None
        of the pesticide oncentrations exceeded U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
        maximum contaminant levels or lifetime health advisories for drinking water.
        Pesticide metabolites were detected in 94 percent of samples from agricultural
        areas and 53 percent from urban areas. Metolachlor ethane sulfonic acid and
        deethylatrazine were the most frequently detected metabolites in samples from
        agricultural areas; metolachlor ethane sulfonic acid and alachlor ethane sulfonic
        acid were the most frequently detected metabolites in samples from urban areas.</p>\n<p>Total
        metabolite concentrations were significantly higher in samples from agricultural
        areas than in samples from urban areas. Total pesticide concentrations (parent
        compounds) tended to be higher in samples from agricultural areas; however,
        this difference was not statistically significant.</p>\n<p>Metabolites constituted
        the major portion of the total residue concentration in the alluvial aquifer.</p>\n<p>Volatile
        organic compounds were detected in 40 percent of samples from urban areas
        and 10 percent from agricultural areas. Methyl tertbutyl ether was the most
        commonly detected volatile organic compound and was present in 23 percent
        of samples from urban areas. Elevated concentrations (greater than 30 micrograms
        per liter) of methyl tert-butyl ether and BTEX compounds (benzene, toluene,
        ethylbenzene, and xylene) in two samples from urban areas suggest the possible
        presence of point-source gasoline leaks or spills.</p>\n<p>Factors other than
        land use may contribute to observed differences in water quality between and
        within agricultural and urban areas. Nitrate, atrazine, deethylatrazine, and
        deisopropylatrazine concentrations were significantly higher in shallow wells
        with sample intervals nearer the water table and in wells with thinner cumulative
        clay thickness above the sample intervals. These relations suggest that longer
        flow paths allow for greater residence time and increase opportunities for
        sorption, degradation, and dispersion, which may contribute to decreases in
        nutrient and pesticide concentrations with depth. Nitrogen speciation was
        influenced by redox conditions. Nitrate concentrations were significantly
        higher in ground water with dissolved-oxygen concentrations in excess of 0.5
        milligram per liter. Ammonia concentrations were higher in ground water with
        dissolved-oxygen concentrations of 0.5 milligram per liter or less; however,
        this relation was not statistically significant. The amount of available organic
        matter may limit denitrification rates. Elevated nitrate concentrations (greater
        than 2.0 mg/L) were significantly related to lower dissolved organic carbon
        concentrations in water samples from both agricultural and urban areas. A
        similar relation between nitrate concentrations (in water) and organic carbon
        concentrations (in aquifer material) also was observed but was not statistically
        significant.</p>","language":"English","publisher":"U.S. Geological Survey","publisherLocation":"Reston,

        \ and streams included measurements of physical properties and determinations\
        \ of the concentrations of nutrients, major ions, organic carbon, trace elements,\
        \ suspended sediment, and dissolved pesticides. Fish-tissue samples were collected\
        \ at two sites in September 1997 and analyzed for organochlorine pesticides.\
        \ In addition, water-quality assessments were made at 25 sites as part of\
        \ a synoptic study in August 1997 and May 1998. A ground-water study was conducted\
        \ to evaluate the effects of agricultural and urban land use on the water\
        \ quality of shallow alluvial aquifers in the study unit. Samples were collected\
        \ and analyzed from wells in 31 agricultural and 30 urban land-use areas during\
        \ June-August 1997. Samples were collected and analyzed from 32 domestic wells\
        \ during June-July 1998 to provide a broad assessment of the water quality\
        \ of shallow alluvial aquifers throughout the study unit. Samples were collected\
        \ during August 1998 from 27 shallow monitoring wells completed in the Iowa\
        \ River alluvial aquifer to evaluate the effects of changing land use on shallow\
        \ ground-water quality. Ground-water samples were analyzed for physical properties,\

        :\"Summary of the major water-quality findings from the Eastern Iowa Basins\
        \ study unit of the National Water-Quality Assessment Program\",\"docAbstract\"\
        :\"<p>An integrated assessment of the water quality in streams and aquifers\
        \ in the Wapsipinicon, Iowa, Cedar, and Skunk River basins was conducted in\
        \ 1996 through 1998 as part of the Eastern Iowa Basins (EIWA) study unit of\
        \ the U.S. Geological Survey's National Water-Quality Assessment Program (NAWQA).\
        \ The EIWA study unit is one of 59 study units across the Nation designed\
        \ to assess the status and trends in the quality of the Nation's ground- and\
        \ surface-water resources and to link the status and trends with an understanding\
        \ of the natural and human factors that affect the quality of water. Over\
        \ 90 percent of the land in the EIWA study unit is used for agricultural purposes,\
        \ while forested areas account for only 4 percent and urban areas about 2\
        \ percent of the land.</p>\\n<p>Surface-water samples were collected monthly\
        \ and during selected storm events from six sites in medium-sized basins (125\
        \ to about 400 mi2) and five sites in large river basins (2,300 to 12,500\
        \ mi2). The medium-sized basins were selected to be representative of various\
        \ physical features, hydrogeology, and agricultural landuse (row crops and\
        \ concentrated animal feeding operations) that may affect water quality. The\
        \ large river sites were selected to determine the integrated effects of combinations\
        \ of landuse and hydrogeology on river-water quality.</p>\\n<p>Ground-water\
        \ samples were collected primarily from the alluvial aquifers because of the\
        \ aquifers' direct hydraulic connection with rivers and streams and because\
        \ alluvial aquifers are one of the most important sources for domestic, municipal,\
        \ and industrial water supplies in the study area. Monitoring wells were installed\
        \ in agricultural and urban areas of the alluvial aquifers to assess the quality\
        \ of the most recently recharged water in relation to land use. Existing domestic\
        \ wells screened in alluvial aquifers and the Silurian/Devonian aquifer were\
        \ sampled to assess deeper and older ground water.</p>\\n<p>Surface- and ground-water\
        \ samples were analyzed for a wide variety of chemical constituents (major\
        \ ions, nutrients, and pesticides) commonly associated with agricultural and\
        \ urban activities. Because they were not expected to occur in rivers and\
        \ streams, volatile organic compounds (VOC's), commonly comprising fuels,\
        \ solvents, and other industrial compounds were only analyzed in ground-water\
        \ samples. The age of the ground water, important information needed to relate\
        \ ground-water quality to land use, was determined using both tritium and\
        \ chlorofluorocarbons (Freon?) age-dating methods.</p>\\n<p>Results from the\
        \ EIWA NAWQA study build on previous and ongoing research and water-quality\
        \ monitoring programs in Iowa and provide new insights into the relation between\
        \ the quality of the State's water resources and human activities. The major\
        \ findings from the study are listed below.</p>\",\"largerWorkType\":{\"id\"\

        \ the first cycle of the National Water Quality Assessment (1992-1996), ground\
        \ water in 20 of the nation&rsquo;s major hydrologic basins was analyzed for\
        \ 90 pesticide compounds (pesticides and degradates). One or more of the pesticide\
        \ compounds examined were detected at 48.4% of the 2485 ground water sites\
        \ sampled. However, approximately 70% of the sites where pesticides were detected,\
        \ two or more pesticide compounds analyzed were present &ndash; documenting\
        \ the prevalence of pesticide mixtures in ground water. The pesticide concentrations\
        \ encountered were generally low, with the median total concentration (summation\
        \ of concentrations for the 90 pesticide compounds) being 0.046 &mu;g/L. Pesticides\
        \ were commonly detected in shallow ground water beneath both agricultural\
        \ (60.4%) and urban (48.5%) areas. This is an important finding because, although\
        \ agricultural activities have long been associated with pesticide contamination,\
        \ urban areas have only recently been recognized as a potential source of\
        \ these types of compounds. Pesticides with higher frequencies of detection\
        \ were generally those with more extensive use, greater environmental persistence,\
        \ and greater mobility in ground water (lower soil-water partition coefficients.).</p>\"\

        \ special issue is devoted to recent and ongoing research relating to the\
        \ fate and transport of agricultural chemicals in the Mississippi River Basin\
        \ by the US Geological Survey Toxic Substances Hydrology (Toxics) Program.\
        \ The Mississippi River Basin drains approximately 3 200 000 km<sup>2</sup>\
        \ representing 41% of the United States. This is the largest river in the\
        \ United States and the third largest in the world. The Mississippi River\
        \ discharges an average of 19 920 m<sup>3</sup>/s of water into the Gulf of\
        \ Mexico. The river is an extensively used resource, supplying drinking water\
        \ to 70 cities in the United States.</p>\\n<p>The Mississippi River Basin\
        \ has undergone dramatic land use and cultural changes over the last 150 years.\
        \ Approximately 70 million people now live within the basin, representing\
        \ approximately 27% of the nation's population. This basin has also become\
        \ one of the most productive agricultural regions in the world in terms of\
        \ both crops and livestock grown. Approximately 65% of the nation's harvested\
        \ cropland is grown in this basin, with more than 100 000 metric tons (t)\
        \ of pesticides and approximately 6 500 000 t of commercial nitrogen fertilizers\
        \ applied to cropland within the basin annually. The drainage of more than\
        \ 20 000 000 ha within the basin has been enhanced by means of tile lines\
        \ and ditches to lower the water table to make the cropland more productive.\
        \ While removing the water from the soil as intended, this practice also leads\
        \ to more rapid transport of contaminants to the river, and ultimately the\
        \ Gulf of Mexico. Furthermore, the extensive chemical use in the Mississippi\
        \ River Basin has led to the transport of pesticides and nitrate into the\
        \ region&rsquo;s streams, aquifers, and atmosphere. An estimated 1 000 000\
        \ t of nitrate-N is transported from the Mississippi River Basin into the\
        \ Gulf of Mexico annually. The peak annual load of herbicides to the Gulf\
        \ of Mexico has been documented at 1920 t. The fundamental goal of the papers\
        \ presented in this volume is to provide a scientific basis for decisions\
        \ necessary to promote sound and efficient agricultural practices and protect\
        \ the quality of the nation's water resources.</p>\",\"largerWorkType\":{\"\

        \ research has been conducted regarding the occurrence of herbicides in the\
        \ hydrologic system, their fate, and their effects on human health and the\
        \ environment. Few studies, however, have considered herbicide transformation\
        \ products (degradates). In this study of Iowa ground water, herbicide degradates\
        \ were frequently detected. In fact, herbicide degradates were eight of the\
        \ 10 most frequently detected compounds. Furthermore, a majority of a herbicide's\
        \ measured concentration was in the form of its degradates &mdash; ranging\
        \ from 55 to over 99%. The herbicide detection frequencies and concentrations\
        \ varied significantly among the major aquifer types sampled. These differences,\
        \ however, were much more pronounced when herbicide degradates were included.\
        \ Aquifer types presumed to have the most rapid recharge rates (alluvial and\
        \ bedrock/karst region aquifers) were those most likely to contain detectable\
        \ concentrations of herbicide compounds. Two indirect estimates of ground-water\
        \ age (depth of well completion and dissolved-oxygen concentration) were used\
        \ to separate the sampled wells into general vulnerability classes (low, intermediate,\
        \ and high). The results show that the herbicide detection frequencies and\
        \ concentrations varied significantly among the vulnerability classes regardless\
        \ of whether or not herbicide degradates were considered. Nevertheless, when\
        \ herbicide degradates were included, the frequency of herbicide compound\
        \ detection within the highest vulnerability class approached 90%, and the\
        \ median total herbicide residue concentration increased over an order of\
        \ magnitude, relative to the parent compounds alone, to 2 &mu;g/l. The results\
        \ from this study demonstrate that obtaining data on herbicide degradates\
        \ is critical for understanding the fate of herbicides in the hydrologic system.\
        \ Furthermore, the prevalence of herbicide degradates documented in this study\
        \ suggests that to accurately determine the overall effect on human health\
        \ and the environment of a specific herbicide its degradates should also be\
        \ considered.</p>\",\"largerWorkType\":{\"id\":2,\"text\":\"Article\"},\"\

        \ the eastern Iowa basins in Iowa and Minnesota, 1996\",\"docAbstract\":\"\
        <p>Fish community data were collected by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)\
        \ at 12 sites in 1996&nbsp;in the Wapsipinicon, the Cedar, the Iowa, and the\
        \ Skunk River Basins in eastern Iowa. The study was done as part of the National\
        \ Water-Quality Assessment (NAWQA) Program of the USGS. This report presents\
        \ an evaluation of the fish communities, the composition and conditions of\
        \ the fish communities,and by relating these compositions and conditions to\
        \ a variety of habitat and water-quality factors.</p>\\n<p>A total of 56 fish\
        \ species representing 13 families were collected from among the 12 sites\
        \ in 1996. The family with the most species represented were the minnows with\
        \ 20. The number of individuals of all species collected in one sampling pass\
        \ ranged from 472 at the Iowa River near Rowan to 2,072 at Wolf Creek near\
        \ Dysart. Fish community composition was similar among many of the stream\
        \ sites. The fish community at 4 of the 5 stream sites, as well as at 2 of\
        \ the large-river sites, was similar to the reference site, the Wapsinicon\
        \ River near Tripoli, an indication that fish communities across the study\
        \ unit are similar. The sites that were the least similar to any of the other\
        \ sites include Flood Creek, a stream site, and the Skunk River at Augusta\
        \ large-river site. The fish communities at both of these sites were dominated\
        \ by relatively few species, many of which are tolerant or represent degraded\
        \ environmental conditions.</p>\\n<p>Biplots of detrended correspondence analysis\
        \ ordinations indicate a gradient from the stream sites to the large-river\
        \ sites. The detrended correspondence analysis ordination also indicates that\
        \ the stream sites are more closely clustered than the large-river sites.\
        \ The large-river sites were more likely to have their ordination driven by\
        \ one or two dominant species, while several species occurred in similar relative\
        \ abundance at many of the stream sites.</p>\\n<p>Several indexes of biotic\
        \ integrity (IBI) based on fish community were applied to the data<br />and\
        \ results were generally comparable. In general, the IBIs indicate higher\
        \ biotic integrity at the stream sites than the large-river sites. Based on\
        \ IBI classifications, fish communities at most sites were degraded compared\
        \ to reference conditions. The fish communities at the 12 study sites appear\
        \ to be related to a number of environmental factors. Obvious differences\
        \ in fish communities occur between the stream sites and the large-river sites,\
        \ the result of differences in both physical and chemical characteristics\
        \ of the streams. Important physical factors related to fish communities included\
        \ several directly related to stream size as well as human population density\
        \ and percent of rowcrops in the watershed. Chemical factors that were important\
        \ included median total phosphorus, suspended-sediment, and dissolved organic\
        \ carbon concentrations.</p>\",\"language\":\"English\",\"publisher\":\"U.S.\

        \ at various locations throughout the United States, particularly during and\
        \ after the Upper Mississippi River Basin flood of 1993, has resulted in analysis\
        \ and discussion of both structural and nonstructural methods of watershed\
        \ management to control flooding. The Upper Mississippi River Basin flood\
        \ of 1993 resulted in the formulation of a Scientific Assessment and Strategy\
        \ Team (SAST) to assist and advise decision makers about the positive and\
        \ negative effects of flood-control measures and habitat restoration (Scientific\
        \ Assessment and Strategy Team, 1994). SAST recognized the role of upland\
        \ processes and the interconnectivity of a management strategy on other parts\
        \ of the river system. If upland areas are considered for inclusion in an\
        \ overall management strategy related to flooding, an analysis of watershed\
        \ that have been flooded and the amount of runoff generated during those floods\
        \ is needed.</p>\\n<p>During the autumn of 1997, the U.S. Geological Survey\
        \ (USGS), in cooperation with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, began\
        \ a study to determine the volume of water associated with recent flood events\
        \ in parts of the Midwestern United States and a preliminary evaluation of\
        \ the potential upland areas for storage of flood-waters in selected watersheds.\
        \ This analysis, although preliminary, may be useful in determining the feasibility\
        \ of conducting additional, more detailed studies into the role of upland\
        \ areas in a watershed management strategy. The methods and results of this\
        \ preliminary hydrologic study are presented in this report.</p>\",\"language\"\

        :\"<p>The introduction of nutrients from chemical fertilizer, animal manure,\

        \ input in the study area. Total nitrogen and total phosphorus loads for 1996\
        \ were estimated for nine of the 12 rivers and creeks using a minimum variance\
        \ unbiased estimator model. A seasonal pattern of concentrations and loads\
        \ was observed. The greatest concentrations and loads occur in the late spring\
        \ to early summer in conjunction with row-crop fertilizer applications and\
        \ spring nmoff and again in the late fall to early winter as vegetation goes\
        \ into dormancy and additional fertilizer is applied to row-crop fields. The\
        \ three largest rivers in eastern Iowa transported an estimated total of 79,000\
        \ metric tons of total nitrogen and 6,800 metric tons of total phosphorus\
        \ to the Mississippi River in 1996. The estimated mass of total nitrogen and\
        \ total phosphorus transported to the Mississippi River represents about 19\
        \ percent of all estimated nitrogen and 9 percent of all estimated phosphorus\
        \ input to the study area.</p>\",\"largerWorkType\":{\"id\":2,\"text\":\"\

        \ contaminant pulses were generated using this parameter set to determine\
        \ the age distribution of sediments at any depth horizon. Because of mixing,\
        \ sediment particles with a wide range of deposition dates occur at each depth.\
        \ A sediment chronology was derived from this age distribution to assign the\
        \ minimum age of deposition and a date of maximum deposition to a depth horizon.\
        \ The minimum age of sediments in a given horizon is used to estimate the\
        \ date of first appearance of a contaminant from its maximum depth of penetration.\
        \ The date of maximum deposition is used to estimate the peak year of input\
        \ for a contaminant from the depth interval with the highest concentration\
        \ of that contaminant. Because of the extensive mixing, sediment-bound constituents\
        \ are rapidly diluted with older material after deposition. In addition, contaminants\
        \ persist in the mixed zone for many years after deposition. More than 75\
        \ years are required to bury 90% of a deposited contaminant below the mixed\
        \ zone. Reconstructing contaminant inputs is limited to changes occurring\
        \ on a 20-year time scale. In contrast, mixing is much lower relative to accumulation\
        \ at a site in San Pablo Bay. Instead, periods of rapid deposition and/or\

        \ Surface-water data were collected, beginning in March 1996, on a monthly\
        \ basis with occasional extra high- and low-flow samples. Data collected from\
        \ 12 sites on rivers and streams in the study unit included determinations\
        \ of the physical properties and concentrations of nutrients, major ions,\
        \ organic carbon, trace elements, suspended sediment, and dissolved pesticides.\
        \ Data collected at four additional sites included physical parameters and\
        \ determination of the concentration of dissolved pesticides. In addition,\
        \ bed-sediment and fish-tissue samples were collected at 16 sites and analyzed\
        \ for trace elements and hydrophobic pesticides. There were two ground-water\
        \ studies conducted in June and July 1996. The first looked at the quality\
        \ of ground water in the Silurian-Devonian and Upper Carbonate aquifers and\
        \ sampled 33 wells once, and the second examined the effects of agriculture\
        \ on shallow ground water of the Iowa River alluvial aquifer and sampled 23\

        :\"<p>We tested 30 prototype global positioning system (GPS) radiocollars\
        \ on brown bears (<i>Ursus arctos</i>) over a 3-year period on the Kenai Peninsula,\
        \ Alaska. Collars were of 2 design types: GPS with an Argos (Argos Data collection\
        \ and Location System) satellite uplink (<i>n=</i>19) and GPS unites where\
        \ the data were stored on board (<i>n</i>=10) for retrieval at a later date.\
        \ All units also contained a conventional VHF (very high frequency) transmitter\
        \ and weighed 1.7 kg. GPS-Argos united obtained 10-82% of expected GPS fixes,\
        \ and fix rate declined significantly (<i>P</i>&lt;0.05) with time after deployment.\
        \ Argos uplink success (proportion of successful transmissions of stored data)\
        \ was linearly related to GPS fix rate (<i>r</i>=0.91,&nbsp;<i>P</i>&lt;0.001).\
        \ Store-on-board units obtained significantly more successful fixes when compared\
        \ with the GPS-Argos units (<i>t</i>=-4.009,&nbsp;<i>P</i>&lt;0.001). Fix\
        \ success rate for deployed store-on-board collars ranged from 13-96%; because\
        \ of the increased number of attempted fixes per day, these collars obtained\
        \ fixes on 97% of days deployed. Accuracy of the GPS units was less than predicted\
        \ by the NAVSTAR GPS technology using&nbsp;the course acquisition code. Reduced\
        \ accuracy was likely a result of the proportion of 2-dimensional versus 3-dimensional\
        \ fixes obtained, although we could not determine this statistic from recorded\
        \ data. Increased overstory closure was the only variable measured that partially\
        \ explained the reduced likelihood of a successful fix. Stem density, stem\
        \ diameter, and overstory height measured within 3 m of the collar did not\
        \ affect fix success. GPS fix success rates for collars attached to bears\
        \ varied more and were lower than fix rates for stationary collars placed\
        \ in various vegetation types, suggesting that the bear, terrain, and movement\
        \ all influence both fix and uplink success rate. Application of this new\
        \ technology to grizzly and brown bear research and comparisons to studies\
        \ with moose (<i>Alces alces</i>) are discussed.</p>\",\"language\":\"English\"\

        :\"<p>Particulate matter was collected at Rio Vista, California, in two study\

        \ 31, 1983 to November 29, 1984. Concentrations of suspended particulate matter\
        \ were measured gravimetrically on silver membrane filters. The pooled standard\
        \ deviation on replicated samples was 1.4 mg/L, giving a coefficient of variation\
        \ of 5.7 percent. Concentrations of particulate carbon and nitrogen were measured\
        \ during a Perkin-Elmer model 240C elemental analyzer to combust material\
        \ collected on glass fiber filters. Refrigeration of samples prior to filtration\
        \ was shown to be a likely influence on precision of duplicate analyses. Median\
        \ deviations between duplicates for carbon were 5.4 percent during the first\
        \ study period and 8.9 percent during the second. For nitrogen, median deviations\
        \ were 4.9 percent and 7.2 percent, respectively. This report presents the\
        \ data for concentrations of suspended particulate material, the duplicate\
        \ analyses for particulate carbon and nitrogen, and the volumes of sample\
        \ filtered for the particulate carbon and nitrogen analyses for both studies.\

        Preventing volcanic catastrophe; the U.S. International Volcano Disaster Assistance\
        \ Program\",\"docAbstract\":\"<p>When the seismograph began to record the\
        \ violent earth-shaking caused by yet another eruption of the Nevado del Ruiz\
        \ volcano in Colombia, no one thought that a few hours later more than 23,000\
        \ people would be dead, killed by lahars (volcanic debris flows) in towns\
        \ and villages several tens of kilometers away from the volcano. Before the\
        \ fatal eruption the volcano was being monitored by scientists at a seismic\
        \ station located 9 km from the summit, and information about the volcano's\
        \ activity was being sent to Colombian emergency-response coordinators who\
        \ were charged with alerting the public of the danger from the active volcano.\
        \ Furthermore, area known to be in the pathways lahars had already been identified\
        \ on maps and communities at risk had been told of their precarious locations.</p>\\\
        n<p>Unfortunately, a storm on November 13, 1985, obscured the glacier-clad\
        \ summit of Nevado del Ruiz. On that night an explosive eruption tore through\
        \ the summit and spewed approximately 20 million cubic meters of hot ash and\
        \ rocks across the snow-covered glacier. These materials were transported\
        \ across the snow pack by avalanches of hot volcanic debris (pyroclastic flows)\
        \ and fast-moving, hot, turbulent clouds of gas and ash (pyroclastic surges).\
        \ The hot pyroclastic flows and surges caused rapid melting of the snow and\
        \ ice and created large volumes of water that swept down canyons leading away\
        \ from the summit. As these floods of water descended the volcano, they picked\
        \ up loose debris and soil from the canyon floors and walls, growing both\
        \ in volume and density, to form hot lahars. In the river valleys farther\
        \ down the volcano's flanks, the lahars were as much as 40 m thick and traveled\
        \ at velocities as fast as 50 km/h. Two and a half hours after the start of\
        \ the eruption one of the lahars reachered Armero, 74 km from the explosion\
        \ crater. In a few short minutes most of the town was swept away or buried\
        \ in a torrent of mud and boulders, and three quaters of the townspeople perished.\

        \ are preceded by surface movements near the volcano. These ground movements\
        \ are the response of the shallow crust to the accumulation of the magma or\
        \ the buildup of magma pressure within a subterranean reservoir beneath the\
        \ volcano. As the magma reservoir expands, the summit and the flanks of the\
        \ volcano rise and spread apart. Measurements made at many volcanoes show\
        \ that slow ground movement may precede an eruption by as many as several\
        \ years. Sudden increases in the rate of ground movement often precede an\
        \ eruption by a few hours or days.</p>\\n<p>At some well-studied volcanoes,\
        \ surface movements of at least several centimeters take place out to distances\
        \ of about 10 km from the summit of the volcano. Widespread deformation of\
        \ this type is relatively easy to monitor, because the necessary survey stations\
        \ can be placed at favorable sites some distance from the summit of the volcano.\
        \ Examples of deformation of this type include Kilauea and Mauna Loa in Hawaii,\
        \ Krafla in Iceland, Long Valley&nbsp;in California, Camp Flegrei in Italy,\
        \ and Sakurajima in Japan. In contrast, surface movement at some other volcanoes,\
        \ usually volcanoes with steep slopes, is restricted to places within about\
        \ 1 km of their summits. Examples of this class of volcanoes include Mount\
        \ St. Helens in Washington, Etna in Italy, and Tangkuban Parahu in Indonesia.\
        \ Local movement on remote, rugged volcanoes of this type is difficult to\
        \ observe using conventional methods of measuring ground movement, which generally\
        \ require a clear line-of-sight between points of interest. However, a revolutionary\
        \ new technique, called the Global Positional System (GPS), provides a very\
        \ efficient, alternative method of making such measurements. GPS, which uses\
        \ satellites and ground-based receivers to accurately record slight crustal\
        \ movements, is rapidly becoming the method of choice to measure deformation\
        \ at volcanoes.&nbsp;</p>\",\"language\":\"English\",\"publisher\":\"U.S Geological\

        :\"<p>The Earth is a dynamic planet. Many different processes are continuously\
        \ developing, creating a delicate balance between the energy stored and generated\
        \ in its interior and the heat lost into space. The heat in continuously transferred\
        \ through complex self-regulating convection mechanisms on a planetary scale.\
        \ The distribution of terrestrial heat flow reveals some of the fine structure\

        \ of earthquakes that had bothered the inhabitants of Pozzuoli and Naples\
        \ all summer long ended abruptly on the eve of St. Michael (September 29)\
        \ in the year 1538. Castaldo recalled that the end of this swarm was heralded\
        \ by a very large earthquake followed immediately by loud thunder, sounding\
        \ like bombardment from heavy guns. This was the beginning of a week-long\
        \ eruption in Campi Flegrei, a volcanic caldera located along the west coast\
        \ of southern Italy near Naples.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>This event has been the only\
        \ eruption of Campi Flegrei in almost 4,000 years. It was preceded by a few\
        \ decades of sporadic earthquakes swarms and noticeable uplift of the shoreline\
        \ and was followed by 430 years of quiescence. Signs of renewed activity was\
        \ first recognized in late 1969. Since then, the caldera center rose as much\
        \ as 3 meters, and several hundred earthquakes were felt from 1983 to 1984\
        \ by people living in Campi Flegrei. These earthquakes extensively damaged\
        \ buildings in Pozzuoli, located in the center of Campi Flegrei, and prompted\

        \ intermediate size earthquakes resulting from the movement of magma within\
        \ the volcano's plumbing system. In the Pacific Northwest, the association\
        \ between earthquakes and volcanoes is much more fundamental- they both arise\
        \ from the same large-scale interaction between two plates of the Earth's\
        \ crust. The oceanic Juan de Fuca plate is being shoved beneath the edge of\
        \ the continental North American plate in the process known as subduction.\
        \ The result is the Cascade chain of volcanoes, the potential for very large\

        \ produce other regional earthquakes.</p>\\n<p>The Pacific Northwest (Oregon,\

        \ Bay, California, two in the northern part of the bay (North Bay) and two\
        \ in the southern part of the bay (South Bay). Considerable variation was\
        \ observed in numbers of species and individuals at the four sites, and abundances\
        \ within species varied widely. Temporal changes in species abundances appeared\
        \ to be related to freshwater inflow patterns and resultant salinity variations\
        \ in the estuary. The 1982-83 winter season was extremely wet, with heavy\
        \ freshwater inflow to the bay from January through March, whereas the 1983-84\
        \ winter was closer to a normal pattern, with most rainfall occurring from\
        \ November through January. Species were grouped into four categories depending\
        \ on their patterns of abundance during the 2-yr period. Species that showed\
        \ an abundance peak in the North Bay in 1983 only were Corophium sp.B and\
        \ a Chironomidae larva, apparently responding to the extended period of lowered\
        \ salinity throughout spring and early summer. Species with an abundance peak\
        \ only in 1984 included Corophium Acherusicum, Eteone californica, Nereis\
        \ succinea, and Grandidierella japonica, typical estuarine species that might\
        \ have been suppressed during the extended freshwater inflows in 1983. Species\
        \ with peaks in both years were Gemma gemma and Ampelisca abdita in the South\
        \ Bay; both showed strong seasonal variations. A number of species in both\
        \ North and South Bays, including dominant members of the intertidal community\
        \ such as Macoma balthical and Streblospio benedicti, did not show any consistent\

        unaltered and alkaline-extracted sediments were used as model particulates
        in separate, controlled deposit-feeding experiments. In general, amounts of
        metal taken up from ingested particles varied dramatically with the nature
        of the particle surface. Ingestion of contaminated iron oxide particles did
        not contribute to overall uptake of Cd and Ag in feeding clams, but accounted
        for 89 to 99% of total Zn uptake. Exopolymer adsorbed on iron oxide particles
        caused an increase in the biological availability of particle-bound metals
        in the order Ag&gt;Cd&gt;Zn, whereas adherent bacteria up to 3.2 X 10<sup>11</sup>

        originated from particulates, even though particle/solute distribution of

        of Cd from alkalineextracted sediments was insignificant, as it was from unamended
        iron oxide. However, addition of exopolymer (10 mgg<sup>-1</sup> sediment)

        columns and radon exchange rates across the sediment-water and air-water interfaces
        have been measured in a section of south San Francisco Bay. Two independent
        methods have been used to determine sediment-water exchange rates, and the
        annual averages of these methods agree within the uncertainty of the determinations,
        about 20%. The annual average of benthic fluxes from shoal areas is nearly
        a factor of 2 greater than fluxes from the channel areas. Fluxes from the
        shoal and channel areas exceed those expected from simple molecular diffusion
        by factors of 4 and 2, respectively, apparently due to macrofaunal irrigation.
        Values of the gas transfer coefficient for radon exchange across the air-water
        interface were determined by constructing a radon mass balance for the water
        column and by direct measurement using floating chambers. The chamber method
        appears to yield results which are too high. Transfer coefficients computed
        using the mass balance method range from 0.4 m/day to 1.8 m/day, with a 6-year
        average of 1.0 m/day. Gas exchange is linearly dependent upon wind speed over
        a wind speed range of 3.2&ndash;6.4 m/s, but shows no dependence upon current
        velocity. Gas transfer coefficients predicted from an empirical relationship
        between gas exchange rates and wind speed observed in lakes and the oceans
        are within 30% of the coefficients determined from the radon mass balance
        and are considerably more accurate than coefficients predicted from theoretical
        gas exchange models.</span></p>","language":"English","publisher":"AGU Publications","doi":"10.1029/JC089iC03p03593","productDescription":"11

        associated with the handling and transporting (hauling) of fishes have long
        been a problem. Tolerance to these stressors varies greatly among species
        (Davis and Parker 1979; Tomasso et al. 1980; Wydoski and Wedenmeyer 1976).
        In most fishes, however, handling and hauling losses are caused by two major
        factors - activation of latent infections as a result of increased endocrine
        activity (cf. Wedemeyer 1970), and osmoregulatory dysfunctions due to blood
        electrolyte disturbances (Lewis 1971; Wydoski and Wedemeyer 1976).</p>\n<p>Basic
        physiological information on the stress caused by current hatchery practices

        In view of the present fishery management requirements for stocking smallmouth
        bas (<i><span>Micropterus dolomieu</span></i>), baseline information on the
        physiological effects of handling and hauling hatchery-reared fish is needed
        to serve as the foundation for improving transport methods. Shell (1959) summarized
        several physiological characteristics of smallmouth bass, but little information
        on their physiological tolerance to stress exists. The present study was designed
        to determine the physiological effects of handling and short-term hauling
        in small mouth bass. Plasma chloride, sodium, potassium, and glucose dynamics

        is a geophysical technique which was developed by Cagnaird (1953) and Tikhonov
        (1950) and later refined by other scientists worldwide. The technique is a
        method of electromagnetic sounding of the Earth and is based upon the skin
        depth effect in conductive media. The electric and magnetic fields arising
        from natural sources are measured at the surface of the earth over broad frequency
        bands. An excellent review of the technique is provided in the paper by Vozoff
        (1972). The sources of the natural fields are found in two basic mechanisms.
        At frequencies above a few hertz, most of the energy arises from lightning
        in thunderstorm belts around the equatorial regions. This energy is propagated
        in a wave-guide formed by the earthionospheric cavity. Energy levels are higher
        at fundamental modes for this cavity, but sufficient energy exists over most
        of the audio range to be useful for sounding at these frequencies, in which
        case the technique is generally referred to as audio-magnetotellurics or AMT.
        At frequencies lower than audio, and in general below 1 Hz, the source of
        naturally occuring electromagnetic energy is found in ionospheric currents.
        Current systems flowing in the ionosphere generate EM waves which can be used
        in sounding of the earth. These fields generate a relatively complete spectrum
        of electromagnetic energy that extends from around 1 Hz to periods of one
        day. Figure 1 shows an amplitude spectrum characteristic of both the ionospheric
        and lightning sources, covering a frequency range from 0.0001 Hz to 1000 Hz.
        It can be seen that there is a minimum in signal levels that occurs at about
        1 Hz, in the gap between the two sources, and that signal level increases
        with a decrease in frequency.</p>","language":"English","publisher":"U.S.

        waters of the Brahmaputra and Ganges rivers arrive. The result is that most
        years about 50 percent of Bangladesh is inundated; in very wet years inundation
        may exceed 70 percent of the total land area. Consequently, over much of the
        country the annual recharge to the ground-water reservoir is large. Annual
        fluctuations of the ground-water level are commonly about 10 feet in the northern
        part of the country. If a storage coefficient of 0.2 is assumed, annual recharge
        may be about 24 inches of water. Although the amount of recharge is different

        to the rice grower since colonial times. The problem has existed wherever
        rice is grown because man, by his culture of rice (Oryza sativa), creates

        than the natural marshes in which they have flourished for centuries.</p>\n<p>In
        the 1700''s and 1800''s, rice was grown in the lowlands of South Carolina,
        Georgia, and North Carolina - on the major migratory route of the bobolink
        (<i>Dolichonyx oryzivorus</i>), the historic \"ricebird\" of that area because
        of its consumption of ripening rice. By the late 1800''s the rice-growing
        industry had largely shifted to the coastal prairies of Louisiana and Texas,
        which are bordered by some 5 million acres of marshland-breeding habitat for
        the redwinged blackbird (<i>Agelaius phoeniceus</i>) and the boat-tailed grackle
        (<i>Cassidix mexicanus</i>). By 1900, rice was being grown on the Grand Prairie
        of eastern Arkansas, which bestrides the largest blackbird flyway in the country.
        In recent decades, rice culture has spread to other sections of Arkansas and
        thence to contiguous areas in Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennesee, and Missouri.
        In effect, then, man has taken the rice to the blackbirds.</p>","language":"English","publisher":"U.S.

        A virus was isolated from both species of fish on tissue culture and the viruses
        showed cross-infectivity. Based upon the pathological changes in the hematopoietic
        tissue and the demonstration of a vital infection, a tentative descriptive
        name was designated Infectious Hematopoietic Necrosis. The isolated viruses

        but has the disadvantages of being slowly absorbed (Snieszko and Friddle,
        1951) and relatively toxic (Wood, Yasutake, and Johnson, 1957). Today there
        are many sulfonamides which are more efficacious than sulfamethazine. In domestic
        animals, sulfisoxazole and sulfadimethoine are absorbed quickly from the gastrointestinal

        The administration of sulfonamide drugs to adult salmon","docAbstract":"<p>The
        artificial propagation of salmon starts with the capture of adults as they
        ascend rivers to spawn. After capture, they are retained in specially constructed
        holding areas until sexually mature. Though holding periods vary with species,
        the spring chinook (<i>Oncorhynchus tshawytsca</i>) may be held as long as
        4 months before they are spawned. During this interval the fish are often
        closely confined at unfavorable water temperatures and fatal diseases sometimes
        reach epizootic proportions. It is important that methods be devised to control
        or prevent infectious diseases in adult salmon while they are in the holding
        ponds.</p>\n<p>Mass treatment is the most convenient way to combat fish diseases.
        For example, drugs can be administered per os in diets, or chemicals can be
        added to the water. These methods are mostly ineffective in treating systemic
        infections of adult salmon because mature salmon do not feed, and many fish
        diseases cannot be controlled by chemical baths. Thus, effective treatment
        would require administering drugs to each individual.</p>","language":"English","publisher":"American

        problems concerning the fisheries of large reservoirs in the Southeast are:
        inefficient and highly selective exploitation of fish stocks, and protection
        and reclamation of damaged or threatened fisheries in tailwaters and tributary
        streams. Seven mainstream reservoirs on which data are available support an
        average angling pressure of 4.9 trips per acre per year and an average catch
        of 16 pounds of sport fish and 6 pounds of food fish. Commercial take is 7
        pounds per acre. The rate of catch of sport fish, based upon tag returns,
        is only 3 percent. Sixteen storage reservoirs support an average angling pressure
        of 5.0 trips per acre per year and an average catch of 13 pounds of sport
        fish and 1 pound of food fish. Commercial catch is of no significance. Average
        rate of catch of sport fish is 17 percent of the catchable population. Fish
        population studies indicate that there are twice as many sport fish and four
        times as many food fish in mainstream than there are in storage reservoirs.</p>\n<p>Some
        reservoirs produce harmful effects downstream. Discharges of cold water may
        seriously reduce fishery values in tailwaters and downstream impoundments.
        Furthermore, migration of non-sport fish from reservoirs into tributary streams
        may reduce fishery values there.</p>\n<p class=\"last\">In recognition of
        these problems, the development and application of sound management procedures
        may be accomplished by controlling species composition and availability of
        fish through water level control, timber clearing, application of selective
        toxicants, commercial fishing, introduction of new fish species, and the management
        of tailwaters and tributaries. Extended research and interagency cooperation
        are necessary to properly develop and apply sound management. Promotion of
        angling and regulation of the fishery may best be realized by providing adequate
        fishing facilities, elimination of certain restricted areas, and in some cases
        revision of laws and regulations. Biologists must not only meet the present
        demands for improved sport fishing but must also balance fish yield by increasing
        the use of food fish by sport and commercial operations.</p>","language":"English","publisher":"Taylor

        electromechanical devices installed in the mouths of streams have proved effective
        in stopping the spawning migrations of the parasitic sea lamprey (Petromyzon
        marinus) which has seriously damaged Great Lakes fisheries. In a few streams,
        excessive mortality has occurred to other fish at the alternating-current
        barriers. A direct-current unit was developed in an attempt to reduce this
        mortality. This direct-current &ldquo;diversion device&rdquo; consists of
        a row of suspended negative electrodes which begins at the end of a trap wing
        and extends across the river at a downstream angle of 45&deg; and a series
        of pipes (positive electrodes) driven into the stream bank. A second array,
        consisting of horizontal pipes installed downstream and parallel to the suspended
        electrodes and connected to a series of rods driven into the bank near the
        positive electrodes, controls the electrical field and dissipates the collecting
        influence of the positive side of the circuit. The electrical field is established
        from the end of the trap wing to the opposite bank. Fish are diverted away
        from the negative electrodes and toward the bank near which the trap is located.
        The array is activiated by pulsated direct current of essentially square wave
        shape with pulses at a duty cycle of 0.66 and a repetition rate of 3 per second.
        Direct-current diversion devices were operated in conjunction with alternating-current
        barriers during 1956 in the Chocolay River, Marquette County, and the Silver
        River, Baraga County, Michigan.</p>\n<p>A total of 15,814 fish comprising
        21 species was handled at the Chocolay River with a mortality of 930, or 5.9
        percent. If mortalities of fish moving downstream are disregarded, only 287,
        or 1.9 percent, of the fish moving upstream were killed in the Chocolay River.</p>\n<p
        class=\"last\">In the Silver River, 78,648 fish comprising 21 species were
        taken from the trap of the direct-current diversion device. The total kill
        of fish moving upstream, including 289 sea lampreys, was 1,016, or 1.3 percent.
        This river had presented a serious problem in the operation of an alternating-current

        of the scales of yellow perch differs with the location on the fish''s body.
        Comparison of scales of Green Bay perch taken above and below the lateral
        line reveals the former to have more sharply defined circuli and to exhibit
        fewer false annuli and less of the shading that impedes accurate assessment
        of age.</p>\n<p>Estimates of age from modes in length-frequency distributions
        and from scale readings were the same for age-groups O, I, and II. Older age
        groups could not be detected in length distributions, but the similarity of
        all annuli makes it acceptable to conclude that the annulus is in fact a year-mark
        at ages beyond the II group.</p>\n<p>Scales of yellow perch may exhibit new
        growth in the latter part of May whereas others may not have started growing
        even in late July. The time of annulus formation varies with calendar year,
        with age (new growth starts earlier in the younger fish), and possibly with
        locality. Ages usually can be read from scales collected during the period
        of annulus formation, but occasionally difficulties are encountered.</p>\n<p>For
        larger yellow perch the relation between fish length and the radius of key
        scales was described by a straight line with a 2-inch intercept on the length
        axis when the scales were taken above the lateral line and by a straight line
        through the origin when the scales came from below the lateral line. Lengths
        calculated from both relations were inaccurate for small fish. Tables of corrections
        are given, based on the body-scale curves for small perch.</p>\n<p>The body-scale
        relations (determined from the same key scale) were similar for Lake Erie
        and Saginaw Bay perch but both differed sharply from the relation in the Green
        Bay populations.</p>\n<p class=\"last\">Good procedure requires high consistency

        major purpose of this publication is to present an annotated bibliography
        of papers resulting from Federal investigations on the Great Lakes fish and
        fisheries since the formal initiation of a continuing research program by
        the Fish and Wildlife Service. It is believed that this purpose can be served
        best by prefacing that bibliography with a brief account of the origins of
        Great Lakes Fishery Investigations, of the circumstances that have guided
        their course. The present article is a revision and expansion of the author''s
        earlier publication: 25 years of Federal Fishery Research on the Great Lakes
        (Special Scientific Report-Fisheries No. 85, 1952). Two circumstances made
        a revision desirable at this time. First, publications since 1952 have added
        greatly to the literature based on Federal studies on the Great Lakes. Second,
        the Great Lakes Fishery Commission, established by treaty with Canada, was
        organized in Ottowa in April 1956 and held its first annual meeting in Ann
        Arbor in November 1956. The entry of the Commission on the scene marks the
        start of an era of further expansion and heightens in past activities.</p>","language":"English","publisher":"U.S.

        total of 2,902 Lake Michigan fish was tagged and released, 48.8 per cent of
        which were lake trout and 85 per cent lake trout, lake herring, and whitefish.
        A total of 388 fish or 13.4 per cent was recaptured. The percentages of returns
        indicated a tremendous fishing intensity for lake trout, whitefish, and sturgeon.
        About 81 per cent of the recaptured fish were retaken within a radius of 25
        miles from the port of tagging (Port Washington, Wisconsin). Lake trout, rainbow
        trout, and sturgeon were found to be extensive travelers; lake herring, whitefish,
        chubs, pilots, and perhaps perch did not migrate so extensively. Lake trout,
        herring, and whitefish tended to move in a northerly direction, perch in a
        southerly, and rainbow trout in all easterly, toward the Michigan shore. Sturgeon
        apparently roam all over the lake. Fifty-three per cent of the recovered lake
        trout were recaptured within one year of release, 73 per cent within 25 miles

        trout moved in all directions from the port of release, although nearly 50
